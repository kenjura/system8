System 8 is a 5e-compatible tabletop RPG system focused on class-based gameplay with unique mechanics for each class. Principal differences from 5e:
- Each class has its own resource system (e.g., Mana, Focus, Vitae) that governs the use of class abilities and spells.
- Streamlined feat system with fewer feats, emphasizing class talents and powers.
- Expanded spell lists and unique schools of magic for spellcasting classes.
