Problem: there are 3 types of rolls: attacks, skill checks, and saves. Each has its own rules and modifiers. Plus, there are "spellcasting checks" which are kind of attacks but also used for other things. This is messy.

Options:
- Everything is a skill check. Add a skill for melee attacks, each type of save, etc.
- Everything is an ability check; if you're good at saving with Charisma, you're good at attacking with it too. But skills are still weird.
- New proficiency system



# Everything is a skill
So we need skills for:
- Melee attack
- Ranged attack
- Each type of spellcasting
- Unarmed attack
- Parry
- Dodge
- Block
- Each type of saving throw (Fortitude, Reflex, Will, Concentration, etc)


Save skills:
- ??? (Str)
- Reflex (Dex)
- Fortitude (Con)
- ??? (Int)
- Concentration (Wis)
- Willpower (Cha)

We've been down this road before. We have to separate these "special" skills from normal skills, or the skill list becomes unmanageable. There are way too many of them.



# New proficiency system

So you've got 6 ability scores.

As you gain levels, you add proficiency bonuses to scores of your choice.

You are "proficient" at everything you do, proportionate to the bonus.

Instead of skill proficiencies, there are skill feats that grant specific benefits.

Each level, you gain two +1 proficiency bonuses to assign to ability scores of your choice. They can't both apply to the same skill. This is a full bonus modifier, so in 5e terms, it's a +2.

Your starting Foundation also includes 3 levels' worth of proficiency bonuses to assign as you like.

Example:
- At level 1, Selina chooses these ability scores:
  - Str -1
  - Dex +2
  - Con +1
  - Int +1
  - Wis +1
  - Cha +3
- Her four level 1 proficiency bonuses are assigned as:
  - +2 to Dex
  - +4 to Cha
  - +1 to Con
  - +1 to Int
- Her final stats at level 1 are:
    - Str -1
    - Dex +4
    - Con +2
    - Int +2
    - Wis +1
    - Cha +7
