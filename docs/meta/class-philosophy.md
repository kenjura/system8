Overall design philosophy:
- 5e Classes == good (except wizard)
- Paths are good, if done right
- Feats are bad
- Multiclassing is...a necessary evil? Hopefully not needed, but should be planned for

In this system, relative to 5e and/or Bertball extended 5e:
- Class and Path both give powers every level
- Nobody should get the classic 3e wizard "2 powers per level" shtick
- Did I just contradict myself? We'll see
- If there are feats, they should be rare (like 5e) and very general. Good feats:
  - Weapon or Armor Proficiency
  - Add another good save
  - Gain a new skill
- Of course, along with ASIs, these constitute improvements to your "basics" that should perhaps just happen anyway?
