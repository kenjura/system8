Should all basic metamagic be rolled into basic maneuvers? Especially since there aren't any feats?

Basic metamagic:
- still
- silent
- extend
- enlarge
- chain
- widen

Things like widen/chain should increase cost (whatever that class uses as cost)

All metamagic requires skill checks and can fail
