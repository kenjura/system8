# Rooted

A condition wherein extreme cold causes a creature's feet to freeze to the ground.

When ''rooted'', subjects movement speed is reduced to zero. Only works on walking speeds, and only if subject is in contact with the ground.


Any effect that causes ''rooted'', when cast by a rank 3 or higher practitioner, and lands upon a creature already ''rooted'', instead causes [frozen](../conditions/frozen).
