Wracked: you suffer pain so severe that you cannot take actions requiring concentration. You can take no actions other than basic attacks and movement. You lose your Dex bonus to AC. Automatically fail Int, Wis, and Cha saves.

Creatures unable to feel pain (such as most constructs) or those immune to psychic damage are immune to this condition.
