A frozen creature is encased in ice, unable to move or take physical actions. They are not actually frozen through. Effects that cause frozen should specify an amount of Hit Points the ice block has. The ice block can be damaged and destroyed; when it is, the creature is freed.

Each round, a warm-blooded creature suffers 20% of the ice block's HP as cold damage, and the ice block loses the same amount.

The ice block is vulnerable to fire and sonic damage and immune to frost, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.
