In the "Frail" state, a creature's Constitution is severely debilated.

- Their max HP are reduced to 50% of normal.
- They suffer disadvantage to all Constitution saving throws.
- Each round the creature takes a standard action, they suffer 1 point of Exhaustion. This is temporary, and is removed if and when the Frail state is removed.
