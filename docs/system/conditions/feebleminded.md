Feebleminded is a state where a creature's Intelligence is severely weakened. They suffer:
- Disadvantage to all Intelligence rolls
- Their power of speech, if present, is reduced to very basic proficiency (think caveman-speak)
- Per DM adjudication, their decision-making reflects their Intelligence being reduced to half
- Complex mental actions, such as spellcasting, suffer a 50% mishap chance
