Foundation is everything that contributed to your character before they started adventuring. It includes a broad array of things, such as:
- Genetic heritage from birth
- Cultural and professional skill development
- Disposition of supernatural entities (i.e. blessed/cursed by the gods)
- Mystical destinies and prophecies
- Literal inheritance of a magic item or special power

While every character is a unique expression of all of these traits and more, for game purposes, you start with three traits in Foundation. You can gain more, or improve the ones you have, as you gain levels.


# Foundation

When you create a character, they gain 3 Foundation "levels". Mostly this just means they gain 3 [Feats](../feats/) from Ancestry or Background. These levels do not include class levels or hit dice.



Ideas:
- Disposition Feats: blessed by a God, born under a Sign, marked by a Mark, etc.
- Equipment Feats: Item of Legacy, Inheritance, etc.
