# Advancement

Certain abilities are granted to all PCs based on their level, regardless of class.

At character creation, you gain 3 [Foundation](../foundation/index.md) levels. These grant the normal benefits of levels as described below, but notably do not include Class levels or Hit Dice.

Each level of advancement (and each foundation level) grants the following benefits:
- **Proficiency Bonus:** Increase two different ability scores by +1 each.
- **Feat:** Choose one [feat](../feats/index.md). These can be [Skill Feats](../feats/skill-feats.md), [Ancestry Feats](../feats/ancestry-feats.md), [Background Feats](../feats/background-feats.md), or feats specific to your [Class](../classes/index.md).

At level 5, 9, 13, and 17, your [Rank](../attributes/rank.md) increases by 1. This grants you access to more powerful abilities and features. Your rank as a PC is separate from your rank as a member of a class. For instance, if you have 5 levels of [Fighter](../classes/fighter.md) and 4 levels of [Rogue](../classes/rogue.md), you are a 9th-level PC, and therefore rank 3 as a PC, but rank 2 as a Fighter and rank 1 as a Rogue.
