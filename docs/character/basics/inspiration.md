Inspiration is a game mechanic in which a character can gain temporary advantages by embodying their character's ideals, bonds, or flaws. 

At character creation, players choose three traits, which represent their aspirations, fundamental motives, or destiny. During gameplay, the PC can petition the GM for Inspiration when they act in accordance with one of these traits. 

The Inspiration game mechanic is a status, which, once awarded, can be expended to gain one of the following boons:
- Reroll a single d20 roll (attack, skill check, saving throw, etc.) and take the better result.
- Take any one action as an immediate action.
- Automatically pass a death saving throw.
