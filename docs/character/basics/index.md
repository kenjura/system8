These are the basics.




# Ability Scores
You begin the game with six values (3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0) to be assigned to the six ability scores however you desire.

Optionally, you can apply -1 to a score to gain +1 to another score (though you cannot increase the 3 to a 4). You may do this twice if you prefer, applying the -1 to a different stat each time.

Every level, you gain two +1 proficiency bonuses to two different ability scores of your choice.

# Foundation
You begin the game with three [Foundation](../basics/foundation) levels which grant three [Feats](../feats/) from the Ancestry or Background types.



# Class and Level
When you gain a level (including 1st), you increase your chosen class by one level.

Yes, multiclassing exists.

Pretend I explained it all here.



# Rank
Depending on your current level, you also have a "rank":

Levels | Rank
-------|-----
1-4    | 1
5-8    | 2
9-12   | 3
13-16  | 4
17+    | 5

Some abilities hae a required rank to use and/or acquire.


## Damage
Any time you encounter the words "light", "medium", or "heavy" in concert with "damage" (e.g. medium fire damage, light slashing damage), it refers to a standard amount of damage based on your rank, proficiency, and ability scores:

Rank | Light Damage | Medium Damage | Heavy Damage
-----|--------------|---------------|-------------
1    | 1d4 + 0.5x   | 1d8 + x       | 1d12 + 1.5x
2    | 2d4 + 0.5x   | 2d8 + x       | 2d12 + 1.5x
3    | 3d4 + 0.5x   | 3d8 + x       | 3d12 + 1.5x
4    | 4d4 + 0.5x   | 4d8 + x       | 4d12 + 1.5x
5    | 5d4 + 0.5x   | 5d8 + x       | 5d12 + 1.5x

The value "x" refers to a modifier containing:
- the ability score used to inflict the damage
- your proficiency bonus, if proficient in the attack
