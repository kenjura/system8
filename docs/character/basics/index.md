These are the basics.




## Ability Scores
You begin the game with six values (3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0) to be assigned to the six ability scores however you desire.

Optionally, you can apply -1 to a score to gain +1 to another score (though you cannot increase the 3 to a 4). You may do this twice if you prefer, applying the -1 to a different stat each time.

Every 4th level (4/8/12/16/20), you gain +1 to two different scores of your choice. You may increase your highest stat with this bonus.


## Foundation
You begin the game with three [Foundation](../foundation/) abilities.

At levels 3, 7, 11, 15, and 19, you gain another one.


## Class and Level
When you gain a level (including 1st), you increase your chosen class by one level.

Yes, multiclassing exists.

Pretend I explained it all here.



## Rank
Depending on your current level, you also have a "rank":

Levels | Rank
-------|-----
1-4    | 1
5-8    | 2
9-12   | 3
13-16  | 4
17+    | 5

Some abilities hae a required rank to use and/or acquire.


### Damage
Any time you encounter the words "light", "medium", or "heavy" in concert with "damage" (e.g. medium fire damage, light slashing damage), it refers to a standard amount of damage based on your rank, proficiency, and ability scores:

Rank | Light Damage | Medium Damage | Heavy Damage
-----|--------------|---------------|-------------
1    | 1d4 + 0.5x   | 1d8 + x       | 1d12 + 1.5x
2    | 2d4 + 0.5x   | 2d8 + x       | 2d12 + 1.5x
3    | 3d4 + 0.5x   | 3d8 + x       | 3d12 + 1.5x
4    | 4d4 + 0.5x   | 4d8 + x       | 4d12 + 1.5x
5    | 5d4 + 0.5x   | 5d8 + x       | 5d12 + 1.5x

The value "x" refers to a modifier containing:
- the ability score used to inflict the damage
- your proficiency bonus, if proficient in the attack



## Skills

When you start the game, you gain 4 [Skills](../skills/) of your choice, plus any bonus skills that may be granted by your [Class](../classes/) or [Foundation](../foundation/) abilities.

At level 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, you may choose to:
- Gain proficiency in a new skill
- Gain expertise in a proficient skill
- Gain mastery in an expert skill (level 10+ only)
