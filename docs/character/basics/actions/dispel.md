*Basic Maneuver*

# Dispel

You can use a spell you know to undo an enemy's spell that is currently active.

- Your spell must be either exactly the same spell, or a natural counter to said spell.
  - For instance, you can dispel **Fireball** with **Fireball**, or perhaps you can dispel it with **Water Sphere**.
  - Natural counters are subject to DM adjudication.
- You must roll a Spellcraft check against the spell's DC:
  - If your roll is greater, the enemy spell ends immediately.
  - Else, no effect.
- Your spell has no effect other than to attempt to dispel. It still has normal Mana cost, casting time, range, etc.
- Your spell must have the same or greater Mana cost as the spell you are dispelling.
  - If your spell costs less Mana, you suffer a -10 penalty to Spellcraft per point of Mana difference.
