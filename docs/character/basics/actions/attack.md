*Basic Action*

# Attack

**Standard Action**

Make a melee or ranged attack against a target within range. Roll your attack roll (d20 + relevant modifiers) against the target's AC. On a hit, roll damage according to your weapon.

You may substitute your Attack action for certain maneuvers or special abilities that specify they can be used in place of an attack.
