*Basic Maneuver*

# Hide

**At-will, Swift, Concentration, Requires concealment**

You hide, becoming invisible to anyone who fails a Wisdom check against your Dexterity check.

While hidden, you can move at up to 50% of your speed without breaking stealth, but you must stay in concealment for all squares of movement. Entering a non-concealed area or taking an action that would break stealth (such as attacking) ends your hidden state.
