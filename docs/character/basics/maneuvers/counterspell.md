By readying an action specifically to counterspell a specific target, you may counter an opponent's spell as he casts it. You must meet the following requirements:

- You must either cast the exact same spell as the caster, or use the [Dispel Magic](</Basics/Maneuvers/Dispel Magic>) maneuver.
- You must act at the same time as the caster. This can be accomplished by:
  - Readying an action
  - Agreeing to act on the same initiative
  - Certain feats or abilities may grant the ability to use a reaction to achieve this timing
- You must be able to see and hear the caster to know when he is casting a spell, and what that spell is.
- If the spell is on cooldown, you cannot counterspell with it.
- If you counterspell with a cooldown spell, you put the spell on cooldown.
- The caster or his target must be within range of the spell you are using to counterspell.
- If all of the above is true, and you are using the same exact spell as the caster, your attempt succeeds with no need to roll.
  - If all of the above is true, except you are using [Dispel Magic](</Basics/Maneuvers/Dispel Magic>) instead of an identical spell, you must still pass any checks required per that maneuver.
- If successful, the opponent's spell is negated entirely. The spell you cast has no effect other that to counter the opponent's spell.
