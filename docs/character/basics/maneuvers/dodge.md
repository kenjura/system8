Dodge is a maneuver that allows a character to avoid an incoming attack by quickly moving out of the way.

At-will, reaction to an attack or targeted spell; you can use your reaction to attempt to dodge the attack. Roll a Dexterity save against the attack roll; if your check is higher, the attack misses you entirely.
