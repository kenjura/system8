Parry is a maneuver that allows a character to deflect or block an incoming melee attack using a weapon or shield.
 
 At-will, reaction to a melee attack; you can use your reaction to attempt to parry the attack. Roll a Strength save against the attack roll; if your check is higher, the attack is deflected and does not hit you.

 Some weapons or shields may grant bonuses to your parry attempts, as noted in their descriptions.
