*Basic Maneuver*

# Parry

**At-will, Reaction to a melee attack**

You can use your reaction to attempt to parry the attack. Roll a Strength save against the attack roll; if your check is higher, the attack is deflected and does not hit you.

Some weapons or shields may grant bonuses to your parry attempts, as noted in their descriptions.
