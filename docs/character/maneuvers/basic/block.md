*Basic Maneuver*

# Block

**At-will, Reaction to an attack, spell, or area effect from your front arc**

You use your shield (or other blocking item) to block some of the damage. The shield description will specify how much damage it can absorb when used to block. For example, if you have a shield that absorbs medium damage, roll a medium damage roll, and subtract that amount from the incoming damage. If the incoming damage exceeds what the shield can absorb, you take the remaining damage as normal. If the shield absorbs all the damage, you take no damage from the attack.
