*Rogue Maneuver (Assassin)*

# Pain Absorption

**At-will, 1 soul shard, Reaction to suffering damage**

Exercising an ancient technique passed from assassin to assassin, you harness the pain of a strike, and convert it into deadly power. Half of the damage of the attack is negated. Furthermore, record the amount that was negated; you can add that amount to a weapon attack within the next 3 rounds.
