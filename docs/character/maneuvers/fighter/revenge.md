*Fighter Maneuver (Protection)*

# Revenge

When you or an ally within melee range takes damage, keep track of it. At any time within one round, you may add this damage to a successful attack you make against the instigator of that damage. You may only have one such "token" active at a time. If another opportunity arrives before you use your token, you can keep the one you have, or accept the new one in its place.
