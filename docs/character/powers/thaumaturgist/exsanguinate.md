At-will, std, ranged; you attempt to remove all of the subject's blood from their body.

On a successful Con save, the subject merely suffers heavy internal damage, plus the [Frail](../../../system/conditions/frail.md) condition (Con ends).

On a failed save, their Hit Points are reduced to 0 and they begin to die.
