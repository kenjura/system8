---

At-will, std, ranged; on a failed Con save, targeted creature becomes an inanimate object (such as a statue, a rock, a chair, etc) of similar size and mass to their original form. They cannot take actions, speak, perceive their surroundings, or move while in this form. They retain their mental faculties and memories, and can take purely mental actions (such as communicating telepathically). The effect lasts until dispelled, or until the objectified creature takes damage. The most damage-resistant material you can turn a creature into is stone (iron at rank 4, adamantine at rank 5).
