At-will, std, touch, 1 mana; you steal a portion of the subject's soul, coalescing it into a tiny crystal called a Soul Shard.

The subject suffers Enervation (TBD)

The uses of a soul shard are as follows:
- Use as the sympathetic component of a phylactery
- Speak with the subject's voice
- Attempt to convince a magical effect that distinguishes between targets that you are, in fact, the creature from whom the soul shard was drained
- As a reaction, you can redirect a targeted magical effect that was about to harm you to the subject instead. This expends the shard.
