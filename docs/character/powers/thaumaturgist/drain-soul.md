At-will, std, touch or eye contact; you steal a portion of the subject's soul, coalescing it into a tiny crystal called a Soul Shard.

The subject suffers 1 level of Enervation per your Witch rank. Enervation causes a -1 penalty to all attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws per level of Enervation. Any creature whose Enervation level exceeds its Constitution score begins to die.

The uses of a soul shard are as follows:
- Use as the sympathetic component of a phylactery
- Speak with the subject's voice
- Attempt to convince a magical effect that distinguishes between targets that you are, in fact, the creature from whom the soul shard was drained
- As a reaction, you can redirect a targeted magical effect that was about to harm you to the subject instead. This expends the shard.

At rank 2, you can expend the soul shard to gain one chosen magical ability of the target (such as a spell-like ability, a class feature, or a supernatural ability) for 1 hour.

At rank 3, you can expend the soul shard as an immediate action to stabilize yourself while dying, or if you suffered instant death, you enter the dying state instead. When this happens, you suffer 1 level of Enervation.
