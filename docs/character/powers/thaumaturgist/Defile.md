At-will, std, ranged, circle 3, 3 Mana; you drain all of the vital energy from everything in the area.

All creatures in the area suffer heavy necrotic damage (Con half). All other life such as plants instantly withers and dies. The energy so extracted flows to you, and you can decide what to do with it.

- You can use the energy to heal yourself and any desired allies within range, splitting the healing evenly.
- You can convert the energy in temporary Mana, gaining 1 for each creature that failed its saving throw, plus 1 if any significant minor life was in the area (such as plant growth or lesser animals). You can use it yourself or split it with allies.
- In lieu of any given point of Mana, a creature can gain a +1d10 modifier to any chosen roll.

All temporary Mana, HP, and roll improvements expire if not used in the encounter.
