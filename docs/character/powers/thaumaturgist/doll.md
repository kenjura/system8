brief: Creature becomes an inanimate object (reversible)

At-will, std, ranged, concentration, 2 Mana; targeted creature is transmuted into an inanimate doll which has roughly the same shape and appearance. It is composed of natural materials (e.g. wood, cloth, leather, straw, bone, etc), but regardless of exact composition, it has Hit Points equal to a medium damage roll (Damage Threshold is 5 per rank).

Subject is allowed a Con save to negate the effect, and a Con save each round to end the effect.

On a failed save, the subject becomes an inanimate object, and thus cannot take any actions. They do, however, retain their consciousness and can perceive the world around them (even if their eyes are buttons). They do not feel pain if their doll is damaged.

If the doll is destroyed, the creature is returned to their original form, in exactly the same condition they were at the moment of transformation. Damage to the doll does not transfer to the creature.

Notes:
- At some point, the Dollhouse item (see Hedgecraft) will allow you to permanently store dolls and suppress the save to end.
