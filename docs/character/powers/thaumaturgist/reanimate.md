Reanimate: Std, ranged, 1 Mana; you animate a recently-dead (within the last hour) corpse of a humanoid or animal. It becomes your [Minion](../../../system/minions.md). The traits of the animated dead are:
- '''Undead:''' immune to death effects, energy drain, etc. Cannot be healed as living creatures would. Vulnerable to abilities that affect undead specifically.
- '''Clumsy:''' disadvantage to Dex checks and saves, cannot Dash or Disengage.
- '''Stupid:''' Int set to 5. They are barely able to understand the simplest of spoken commands, with the aid of gestures and nonverbal communication. They lose any spellcasting abilities, skills, feats, class features, and proficiencies. If wielding martial weapons, they are disadvantaged on attack rolls (but are fine with simple weapons).
- '''Doomed:''' At the end of the duration of the spell, they die once more, and cannot be raised again with Reanimate.
