Flavor text.

Uses:
- Transfusion: at-will, std, touch or ranged (if you are touching their blood), Con half (when harming); transfer HP between yourself and the subject in the direction of your choice. When healing, you can transfer no more HP than would reduce you to 0 or fully heal the target (whichever amount is lower). When harming, you can transfer no more HP than would fully heal you.



Relevant talents:
- [Blood Bank](#): Allows you to "overheal" as temp HP. This removes the cap on Transfusion healing you to max.
