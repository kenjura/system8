At-will, swift, ranged, 1 Mana; subject undead creature suffers heavy internal damage (Con half), and you heal the amount suffered. Alternatively, you can direct the healing to someone else by touching them (if within reach) or a phylactery or keepsake of theirs.

If the subject is a minion under your control, you may direct them to fail the saving throw.

If you have an undead minion in the encounter, you may use this power as a reaction upon being reduced to zero Hit Points, targeting the minion.
