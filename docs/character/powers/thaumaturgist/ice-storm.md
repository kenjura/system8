---

You summon a storm of ice and sleet in a target area, damaging and hindering enemies within.

At-will, std, ranged, concentration, 2 Vitae; choose a point within range. A storm of ice and sleet erupts in a 2+1/rank radius area centered on that point. Enemies in the area suffer medium cold and piercing damage on initial burst, and the same at the start of their turn while in the area. The area becomes slippery terrain for enemies (moving above 50% of current max speed requires a Dex save to avoid falling prone), and they suffer chilled (Con ends) while in the area.
