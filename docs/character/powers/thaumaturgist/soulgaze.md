At-will, std, ranged, 1 Mana, concentration; you gaze into subject's eyes. If subject averts eyes, spell fails. You pry into subject's mind, gazing into his soul. While your gaze remains locked, you may learn things about the subject, learning the answer to one question about the subject per round (Cha ends). Each time you learn an answer, the subject learns one random fact about you in return.
