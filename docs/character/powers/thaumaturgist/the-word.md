At-will, std, audible range, 2 Vitae; you speak a command word or phrase imbued with divine power. The target must comply with your command on its next turn, provided it is able to understand you. Each round, the subject is allowed a Cha save to end the effect. If you command them to do something deeply against their nature or self-destructive, they gain advantage on the save.
