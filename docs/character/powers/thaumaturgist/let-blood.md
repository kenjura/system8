brief: Let your own blood, then use it for various purposes
---

At-will, swift; you let a small amount of your own blood, suffering 1d6 damage. You can then use that blood for one of the following effects:
- Wall of Blood: std; create a line of blood one square long per proficiency bonus, or a circle up to 1 radius per rank, which ignites in small, candle-like flames that shed dim light in a 5-foot radius. The wall lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it (no save). The wall does not block any physical effects, but magic crossing it that is not under your control is subject to a dispelling check (roll once when casting; any spell whose DC is less than yours is nullified).
- Blood Mark: std, touch; you mark subject with blood. Thereafter, you can target them with touch effects from any distance, and any saving throws against such spells have disadvantage. The mark lasts up to 1 hour per level, but can be washed off with an action.
- Blood Bond: std, touch; you create a bond between yourself and a willing ally. Thereafter, either of you can choose to suffer half the damage from any source that would affect the other, instead of them. Each of you can enhance a chosen ability score of the other to match your own for as long as the bond lasts. The bond lasts up to 1 hour per level, and you can have only one such bond active at a time. The bond ends if either of you drops to 0 HP or dies.

At-will, std, melee attack; you (or your familiar) attack with a slashing or piercing weapon (such as your athame). If you cause damage, you can use the blood on the blade for one of the following effects:
- Blood Boil: subject suffers medium internal fire damage on turn start (Con ends). While the effect is active, any slashing or piercing damage the target suffers causes a burst 1 of medium fire damage affecting enemies only.
- Blood Puppet: requires rank 2. While you concentrate, you control subject's physical movements as if they were a marionette. They can make basic attacks and move, but cannot take any other actions. They can make a Con save at the end of each of their turns to end the effect.
- Phylactery: you can create a phylactery of the subject as a swift action.

Talents:
- Greater Wall of Blood: the wall of blood can now block physical effects as well as magical ones.
- Shared Bond: you can have one additional blood bond active at a time.

At-will, swift; you inflict the full damage of a slashing or piercing weapon attack on yourself (such as with your athame). Thereafter, for 3 rounds, you can add that amount to the damage of your spells.
