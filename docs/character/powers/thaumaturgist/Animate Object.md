name: Animate Object
school: Transmutation
rank: 1
type: Control
brief: Object becomes animated and acts as you direct
---

At-will, std, ranged, concentration, 1 Mana; medium-sized (or smaller) object becomes animated and moves as you direct.

If fixed in place, the object can take limited actions, based on its physical configuration. For instance, a door can open or close, and can attempt to bash targets within its reach, but is stuck on its hinges. In this case, the object uses your spellcasting skill as its roll for all actions (such as a door resisting being opened/closed by an enemy).

If free-standing, the object can use locomotion, and acts like a creature, with move and standard actions each round. In this case, it counts as your Minion, and uses the stats of an Animated Object from the Monster Manual (for now).

At rank 2, you can create a Large animated object for 2 Mana. At rank 3, Huge. Etc.
