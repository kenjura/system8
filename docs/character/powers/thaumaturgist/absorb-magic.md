At-will, std, touch; you drain 1 Vitae per Witch rank from a spell affecting the target. If the spell was not cast by you or an ally, it resists. Roll a Con save against the spell's DC; on success, you absorb the energy and take no damage. On failure, you still absorb the energy, but you suffer light internal damage per rank of the spell.

All spells have an energy cost, and if not specified in the spell description, it is 1 energy per rank of the caster. If the cost was equal to or less than what you absorbed, this completely dispels the spell. If the cost was higher, roll a pro-rated chance to dispel it based on the amount that was absorbed.
