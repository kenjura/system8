Flavor text.

Uses:
- Ice Lance: at-will; as a swift action, you absorb energy from the environment, freezing the latent moisture and the air itself into a sharp lance of ice. As a standard action (which can be in a later round), you attack with said lance in melee or as a ranged missile attack, inflicting heavy cold damage plus [chilled](/system/conditions/chilled.md) (Con ends).
- Frost Barrier: at-will, swift, concentration; you absorb energy from your immediate environment, which causes the air and moisture around you to freeze into a barrier of armor. Gain Absorb 100% (max medium damage, max per hit 5 per rank, all types but fire).
- Frost Nova: recharge 33%, std, close burst 2; enemies suffer medium cold damage plus [rooted](/system/conditions/rooted.md) (Con ends).

Rank 2:
- Wall of Ice: recharge 33%, swift, ranged, concentration, wall 1/level; wall of ice 10-ft high and 3-ft thick has HP = 300% heavy damage (fire vulnerable, cold immune), and blocks line of sight and line of effect.
- Freeze:
  - Freeze Self: recharge 33%, swift, concentration; you are encased in a thick block of ice which has HP = 200% heavy damage (normal damage from all types, vulnerable to fire, immune to cold). While inside, you cannot take physical actions, but also cannot be targeted or affected by anything outside the ice. If the ice block is reduced to 0 HP, it shatters, and you are no longer protected or unable to act.
  - Freeze Other: recharge 33%, std, ranged, concentration; subject is encased in a thick block of ice which has HP = 200% heavy damage (takes normal damage from all types, vulnerable to fire, immune to cold). While inside, subject cannot take physical actions, but also cannot be targeted or affected by anything outside the ice. When cast, subject is allowed a Con save--on success, they suffer heavy cold damage plus [chilled](/system/conditions/chilled.md) but are otherwise fine. Otherwise, they are imprisoned as described. On turn start, subject suffers 25% of the ice block's HP in cold damage, which reduces the ice block's HP by that amount. If the ice block is reduced to 0 HP, it shatters, and subject is no longer protected or unable to act.

Rank 3:
- Frost Bomb
- Relentless Winter
