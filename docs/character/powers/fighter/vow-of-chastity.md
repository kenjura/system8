*Class Feat*

# Vow of Chastity

You are immune to charm effects. Your attitude toward a creature cannot be magically modified, nor can you be forced to be attracted to a creature through magic or persuasion. To maintain this ability, you must vow to refrain from the temptations of the flesh, including sexual activity.

At rank 2, you gain advantage to saves against compulsions or emotion effects of any kind.
