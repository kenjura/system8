# Detect Evil

At-will, swift, concentration; you gain the ability to see the auras of evil creatures. Any creature or magical effect that is necrotic or infernal in nature appears as an aura within your vision. These auras can be obscured by cover or concealment, but cannot be hidden by illusions (such as a demon disguising as an innocent person, or an undead creature using invisibility), because the illusion itself is a detectable aura.
