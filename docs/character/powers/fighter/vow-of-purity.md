*Class Feat*

# Vow of Purity

You are immune to poison and disease. To maintain this ability, you must vow to treat your body as a temple and consume no poisons, such as alcohol or drugs.

At rank 2, you gain advantage to saves against hostile transmutations (any magical effect that modifies your body).
