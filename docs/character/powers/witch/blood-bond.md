You link yourself to another creature, allowing you to share strength and vitality with each other. Can be used offensively.

At-will, std, touch (either the creature or their blood), concentration; you create a link between yourself and the creature. Choose one ability score; both of you now have the higher score. Also, when either of you takes damage, you may choose to share the damage equally between each other.

When used offensively:
- The effect has a Con save to end
- The enemy's ability score becomes the lower of the two (yours is the higher)
- You can split your damage to the enemy, but theirs does not split to you
