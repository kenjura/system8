At-will, std, ranged, 2 Vitae; target creature made of flesh explodes (it need not be a corpse). The creature suffers heavy internal damage (Con half, if not a corpse), and this reduces them to 0, or if the target was a corpse, their body is obliterated in a burst 3 of explosive damage.

When this explosive damage strikes a corpse, or inflicts enough damage to reduce the subject to 0, it triggers a Corpse Explosion on that target as well. This can cause a cascade of explosions.
