name: Hallucination
school: Eyes
rank: 3
type: Control, Illusion
brief: Redefine what everyone in an area sees and perceives
---

At-will, std, concentration, ranged, 2 Vitae; you project a mass hallucination into the minds of all creatures within a close burst 5. You control what they perceive, which can include any combination of visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile sensations. The hallucination can:
- Make creatures or objects appear different than they are
- Create illusory creatures, objects, or terrain features
- Hide existing creatures, objects, or terrain (they become invisible to affected creatures)
- Change the apparent layout of the area entirely

Affected creatures believe the illusion is real. If they interact with an illusory object in a way that would reveal its nature (walking through an illusory wall, striking an illusory creature), they may attempt a Wisdom save to disbelieve. Creatures who disbelieve can still see the illusion but recognize it as false.

Creatures can be harmed by their belief: an illusory fire deals medium psychic damage to believers who touch it; an illusory pit causes them to fall prone and believe they are falling. However, belief alone cannot kill—a creature reduced to 0 HP by illusory harm is instead rendered unconscious and stabilized.

At rank 4, you can affect all creatures within line of sight, regardless of area, at a cost of 4 Vitae. Your hallucinations can now deal heavy psychic damage.

At rank 5, your hallucinations become semi-real. Creatures who believe take real damage of the appropriate type (illusory fire deals fire damage, etc.), and illusory terrain provides real cover and difficult terrain even to disbelievers.

Talents:
- Nightmare Weaver: when you create threatening hallucinations, affected creatures must save vs fear (Wis ends) in addition to the other effects.
- Persistent Vision: your hallucinations persist for 1 minute after you stop concentrating, though you cannot modify them during this time.
- Personal Hell: you can create a hallucination affecting only a single target, which cannot be perceived by others. This costs only 1 Vitae but requires a Wisdom save to resist entirely.
