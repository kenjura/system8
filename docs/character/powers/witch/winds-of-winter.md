# Howling Winds

You create a constant blast of bitter wind, emanating from you, blasting snow in the face of enemies, and making it difficult to see or hear.

At-will, std, emanation 2+1/rank, concentration, 1 Vitae; you and allies gain partial concealment to enemies adjacent within 2 squares, and total concealment to enemies further away. 

Enemies must pass a Str save to move toward you; on success, they can move at half speed, and on failure, they make no progress. Small or flying creatures have disadvantage on this save.

The cold is bitter, but not enough to cause frost damage directly. However, at rank 2, the cold increases. Enemies suffer light damage at the start of their turn while in the area, plus chilled (Con ends). At rank 3, the damage increases to medium, plus rooted (Con ends, replaced with chilled, Con ends).

# Thin Air

You rarify the air around you, making it difficult to breathe, speak, or hear, quelching gaseous effects, and smothering flame.

At-will, std, circle 2+1/rank, ranged, concentration, 1 Vitae; subjects in the area suffer light internal damage from low pressure on each turn start. Creatures that rely on speech to cast spells or use powers have disadvantage on those checks while in the area. Gaseous effects (such as fog cloud) are suppressed while in the area. Non-magical flames are extinguished upon entering the area, and magical flames suffer half damage while in the area. Flying creatures must land.

At rank 2, the air is thinned more. Subjects suffer medium internal damage on each turn start. Creatures that rely on speech to cast spells or use powers cannot do so while in the area. Ongoing magical flames are extinguished. Flying creatures fall, suffering fall damage as normal.

At rank 3, the area become a total vacuum. Subjects suffer heavy internal damage on each turn start. Creatures that breathe air suffer 1 rank of exhaustion per round.


Water elementals suffer double damage from the internal damage effects of this power.
