# Duplicates
At-will, swift, concentration; you create 1 per proficiency bonus illusory duplicates of yourself or another target within range. The duplicates mimic the actions of the target. Attacks and targeted spells affect a randomly chosen image. Each image has only 1 HP and no special resistances (even if the target has them).

# Dark Mirror
At-will, std, concentration, ranged, 1 Vitae; you create a mirror image of a target within range. They have the same physical form and capabilities as the target, but are quite insubstantial. They have HP equal to a medium damage roll, and no special resistances (even if the target has them). They can take basic physical actions, such as attacking, but cannot use magical or supernatural abilities of the target.

At rank 2, the image can use magical abilities the target possesses, but you must pay the Vitae cost of each one. Their HP increases to a heavy damage roll.

At rank 3, the image's HP match the target's, if higher than a heavy damage roll.
