# Mirror Gate

At-will, std, ranged, 3 Vitae; you turn any mirror large enough to see your complete eye into a portal to the mirror dimension. As a move action, you instantly teleport to your reflection's position within the mirror dimension. If the mirror is large enough, you can simply walk through it, and others can too, if you allow it.

The mirror dimension is a parallel plane of existence that mimics the physical world, but is largely empty. It contains only other mirrors, and reflections of creatures and objects that have entered it. While in the mirror dimension, you can see into the physical world through any mirror within 100 squares, and can step through any mirror to enter the physical world again.
