# Eyebite
At-will, std, ranged (eye contact); you fix your malevolent gaze upon a target, causing them intense pain (heavy psychic damage, Wis save for half). You gain 1 Vitae when the target takes damage from this effect.

# Withering Gaze
At-will, std, ranged (eye contact); you fix your malevolent gaze upon a target, cursing them with a lingering malady. Each round at the start of their turn, the target takes light necrotic damage. Whenever they inflict damage, roll damage twice and use the lesser result. Con ends the effect. You gain 1 Vitae each time they suffer damage from this effect.

# Overlooked
At-will, std, ranged (eye contact); you fix your malevolent gaze upon a target, causing them to be overlooked by others. When any of the target's allies attempt to take an action to aid the target, they must pass a Wisdom save to do it; on failure, they must take an action that does not help the target. The target suffers 50% reduction to incoming healing, and must make a compulsory Cha save to reject any spells that remove debilitations or conditions from them. Wis ends this effect. You gain 1 Vitae every time an ally fails to aid the target due to this effect.

Any effects that involve inspiration, such as a Commanding Shout, or Bardic Inspiration, fail to effect the target.

# Covet
At-will, std, ranged (eye contact); you fix your malevolent gaze upon a target, and succumb to envy of their abilities. You gain one use of one of the subject's powers or feats (your choice), which must be of a rank you can normally use. You must spend the normal action to manifest this power or feat, but any energy cost is paid by the target.
