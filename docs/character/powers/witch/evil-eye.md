brief: Curse a target with your gaze, gaining Vitae
---

At-will, swift, ranged (eye contact); you fix your malevolent gaze upon a target, cursing them with ill fortune. The target suffers disadvantage on their next attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. You gain 1 Vitae.

Or, at-will, std, ranged (eye contact); you intensify your cursed gaze, inflicting a more potent hex. The target suffers one of the following effects of your choice:
- Evil Eye of Misfortune: the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls until the end of their next turn.
- Evil Eye of Weakness: the target's damage is halved until the end of their next turn.
- Evil Eye of Vulnerability: the target's AC is reduced by your proficiency bonus until the end of their next turn.

You gain 1 Vitae per Witch rank.

At rank 2, the effects of your Evil Eye last until the target passes a Wisdom save at the end of their turn.

At rank 3, you can affect all enemies within a close burst 3 who can see you with the swift action version of this power.

Talents:
- Lingering Gaze: your Evil Eye effects persist for 1 additional round after the target would normally save.
- Piercing Stare: you can use Evil Eye on targets who cannot see you, as long as you can see them. The effect manifests as an oppressive feeling of being watched.
- Evil Eye Adept: when you use the swift action Evil Eye, you may choose any of the three hex effects instead of just disadvantage on one roll.
