class: Witch
name: Chill Touch
school: Winter
rank: 0
type: Assault, debilitation, utility
brief: Draw Vitae from the environment or a creature, making them cold
---

At-will, swift; you draw Vitae from the environment, making the air deathly cold around you (but not enough to cause frost damage directly). You gain 1 Vitae per Witch rank. If you wish, you can concentrate the rime, frost, and ice into a useful object up to medium size, such as a weapon or shield, which lasts for the rest of the encounter.

Or, at-will, std, touch; you draw Vitae from a creature, dealing medium cold damage plus [chilled](../conditions/chilled) (Con ends). This grants you 1 Vitae per Witch rank.

At rank 2, you can create a large object, or a wall of ice up to 1 square long per proficiency bonus, with HP equal to a heavy damage roll, which lasts as long as you concentrate. Also, your cold damage increases to heavy, and the target is [rooted](../conditions/rooted) (Con ends, replaced with chilled, Con ends).

At rank 3, you can create a huge object, or a wall of ice up to 2 squares long per proficiency bonus. Also, when targeting a creature, they are [frozen](../conditions/frozen) (Con ends, replaced with rooted, Con ends); the ice block's HP equals a heavy damage roll.

Talents:
- Icy Grasp: you can use the touch version of the power at range.
- Chill Aura: at-will, std, close burst 2+1/rank; you gain 1 Vitae per rank, and the air becomes so cold that enemies in the area take light cold damage and are chilled (Con ends) at the start of their turn.
- Frostwright: the objects you create are magically imbued and more powerful than mundane ice.


# Frostwright

## Frostwrought Weapons 
A frostwrought weapon deals cold damage equal to its normal damage, plus chilled (Con ends) on a hit. When striking a chilled target, the target is rooted (Con ends, replaced with chilled, Con ends) instead, if you are rank 2 or higher. When striking a rooted target, the target is frozen (Con ends, replaced with rooted, Con ends) instead, if you are rank 3.

Frostwrought weapons can be melee, used normally, or they can be ranged, animated by your magic. You still use a standard action to attack with the ranged weapon, but you can hurl it through magic alone, and recall it as a free action.

## Frostwrought Shields

A frostwrought shield can be used to block (medium damage), or to parry (with your spellcasting skill, not a Str save). It animates to float in front of you (or an ally you choose), requiring no hand or shield proficiency.

## Frostwrought Armor

Frostwrought armor provides standard armor benefits if you duplicate normal armor, but it can also be a thin coating of ice granting your proficiency bonus + spellcasting stat bonus to AC.

The armor is cold to the touch; attackers who strike you with melee attacks suffer medium cold damage plus chilled (Con ends) (stacking to rooted/frozen as normal).

When you suffer damage, you may choose to ablate the armor, limiting the damage you suffer to 10% of your max HP. The armor can suffer one of these strikes per your Witch rank before it dissolves.

## Frostwrought Walls

Instead of the whole wall having one HP pool, each square has its own HP pool equal to a heavy damage roll. When broken, that 5-ft length of wall no longer blocks movement, vision, or line of effect. However, crossing the wall causes heavy cold damage plus rooted (Con ends, replaced with chilled, Con ends), or frozen if subject was already chilled and you are rank 3+.

Broken wall segments regenerate, regaining 50% of max HP at the start of your turn if not shattered. If shattered, they do not regenerate for the first round, but begin to regenerate normally after that. If a subject is rooted or frozen in that square, they become incorporated into the wall, suffering the [frozen](../conditions/frozen) condition until that wall segment is shattered again.


You can use a standard action to cause a wall to shatter, dealing heavy cold damage to all within 2 squares of the wall; creatures hit are chilled (Con ends) (escalating normally).
