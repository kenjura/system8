type: Defense, Utility
brief: Gain precognitive awareness of danger, and react accordingly

At-will, swift, concentration, 2 Vitae; you attune your mind to the threads of fate, perceiving danger before it manifests. While this power is active:
- You cannot be surprised.
- You have advantage on all saving throws.
- Attackers do not gain advantage against you from any source (flanking, invisibility, etc.).
- You gain a +2 bonus to AC.

Additionally, once per round, when you or an ally within 10 squares would be affected by an attack or harmful effect, you may use a reaction to grant them advantage on their saving throw, or impose disadvantage on the attack roll against them.

Or, at-will, std, 3 Vitae; you glimpse a possible future in vivid detail. You may ask the GM one question about the likely outcome of a specific course of action you are considering. The GM describes what you foresee, which represents the most probable outcome given current circumstances. Note that the future is not fixed—your foreknowledge may itself change the outcome.

At rank 5, your foresight becomes nearly absolute. While concentrating on this power, once per encounter, you may declare that you foresaw the current situation and prepared accordingly. You may retroactively declare one reasonable preparation you made (an item you brought, an ally you positioned, a trap you set, information you gathered) that now comes into play.

Talents:
- Prescient Counter: when you use your reaction to help an ally against an attack, if the attack misses, the attacker provokes an opportunity attack from you or that ally.
- Fateful Guidance: you can extend your foresight to protect up to 3 allies within range; they gain the defensive benefits of Foresight while you concentrate, but this costs an additional 1 Vitae per ally.
- Glimpse of Mortality: once per day, when you or an ally within range would be reduced to 0 HP or killed, you may use a reaction to declare that you foresaw this death and intervened. The attack or effect instead reduces the target to 1 HP. This costs 4 Vitae.
