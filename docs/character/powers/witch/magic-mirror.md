# Mirror Speak

At-will, swift, concentration; you enchant a mundane mirror within range to allow communication through it. If you possess a sympathetic component to another mirror, you can link the two mirrors together, allowing communication between them over any distance. If you have a sympathetic component to a specific person, you can link the mirror to that person's reflection, allowing communication with them wherever they are.

# Mirror Memory

At-will, std, concentration; you enchant a mundane mirror, such that you can see what it has reflected in the past. At rank 1, you can rewind up to 1 day; at rank 2, up to 1 month; at rank 3, up to the lifetime of the mirror. You can only see, not hear, what was reflected.

# Mirror of Divination

At-will, std, concentration you enchant a mundane mirror to be an instrument of divination. For 1 Vitae, you may ask a single question (who, what, where, when, why, or how) and the mirror will show you a brief vision that provides cryptic insight into the answer. The GM provides the vision, which may be symbolic or literal.

# Mirror Trap

At-will, std, touch; you enchant a mundane mirror so that it traps a portion of a creature's soul when they look into it. Thereafter, as a standard action, you can point the mirror at a target, inflicting 1 level of Enervation (-1 to all d20 rolls, and if a creature has as many Enervation stacks as their Hit Dice, they must pass a Con save or start to die). You gain 1 Vitae.

At higher ranks, you inflict your Witch rank in Enervation levels, and correspondingly gain that many Vitae when the mirror is used.
