# See the Unseen
At-will, swift, concentration, 2 Vitae; you open your inner sight, allowing you to perceive what is hidden from normal vision. While active, you gain the following benefits:
- You can see invisible creatures and objects.
- You automatically recognize illusions for what they are and can see both the illusion and the reality beneath.
- You can see in magical darkness as if it were normal light.
- You can perceive the presence and school of active magical effects within range.

# Foresight
At-will, swift, concentration, 2 Vitae; you focus your sight to peer into the immediate future. For the duration, you have advantage on all saving throws, and enemy attacks against you are disadvantaged. Additionally, once per round, when you or an ally within range is about to suffer damage or debilitating effects, you can use your reaction to take any move or swift action that might avoid or mitigate the harm (such as dodging, taking cover, or using an ability). At rank 3, you can spend 3 Vitae to see slightly further into the future, allowing you to take a standard action as well.

# Sight Beyond Sight
At-will, std, 2 Vitae; you extend your mystic sight into the near future. For a single proposed course of action, such as "opening this chest", or "attacking that guard", you can see a brief vision of the likely outcome. This vision tends to be low on details, but enough to give you a sense of whether the action will have a good or bad outcome, or a mix of both, or neither.


# Talents
- Third Eye: the concentration duration of Mystic Eyes becomes "encounter" instead.
- Soul Sight: while using Mystic Eyes, you can perceive the alignment, emotional state, and general power level (rank) of creatures you observe. You can tell if a creature is capable of magic or supernatural abilities, and what type (witch, psion, cleric, etc).
