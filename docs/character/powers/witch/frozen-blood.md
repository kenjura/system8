At-will, swift, concentration, 3 Mana.

Your heart stops, and your blood flows with all the quickness of tree sap. You are no longer subject to the Dead or Dying states. Even if you take enough damage to be reduced to zero Hit Points, you remain active and capable.

Keep track of the damage you suffer in this state. As soon as the state ends, you suffer the normal effecst of that much damage. Thus, if you are at zero, you will start Dying, and if your total damage is equal to 200% of your max HP, you will die instantly.

This damage can be healed through normal means, including [Transfusion](#).
