brief: Banish a target to a prison-like mirror dimension
---

At-will, std, ranged, 4 Vitae; you attempt to imprison a target within range by banishing them to a special mirror dimension. The target must pass a Charisma save or be trapped in a hovering shard of magical glass. Their experience is that they are in a vast void, with only the light coming through the mirror for solace, and the mirror's surface is an impenetrable barrier. They cannot communicate with the outside world.

If the mirror is shattered (it has HP equal to a heavy damage roll and is vulnerable to bludgeoning and sonic damage), the target is freed and falls prone in an unoccupied square adjacent to the mirror's previous location. 

On each of the creature's turns while imprisoned, they may attempt the Charisma save again to escape. On success, they shatter the mirror from within and are freed as above. With the first failed save, they start to drift away from the mirror, giving them disadvantage on future saves. With a second failed save, they drift out of range of the mirror, and cannot attempt further saves, as they drift into an endless void. They remain imprisoned until the mirror is shattered from the outside.

You can take several actions affecting the mirror while the target is imprisoned:
- You can move the mirror up to 5 squares as a swift action on your turn.
- You can shatter the mirror at will as a free action.
- You can shrink the mirror to half size as a swift action, once per round. If you do this again, it becomes a hand-held mirror, which is the limit of how small it can get. You can reverse this process as a swift action, growing the mirror back to its original size.
- You can handle the mirror as a normal object, including hiding it, carrying it, or putting it in a bag or container.
