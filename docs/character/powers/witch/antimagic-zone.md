At-will, std, centered circle 1-2, concentration, 3 Vitae; create an antimagic zone that suppresses all magic within it, except for this spell.

All magical effects originating within the area simply fail. They do not begin duration, they fail at casting time. This affects all forms of magic, including spells, magical items, and supernatural abilities.

If an ongoing magical effect is centered or targeted on an object or creature outside the area, but it then enters the area, the effect is totally nullified while within the area. When it leaves the area, the effect resumes as normal, with no loss of duration.

Any area effect centered outside the area functions normally within its area of effect, except for the portion that overlaps with the antimagic zone.

Antimagic zones are not subject to dispelling, since any spell that could dispel it would simply fail to reach the center. They can be counterspelled, if the caster is reacting to the casting of this spell.

Gods and other immensely powerful beings can choose to have their magic function normally within an antimagic zone, if they so desire.
