brief: Convince the minds of onlookers that you are not there, or are someone else
---

At-will, std, concentration, 1 Vitae; you weave a glamour over yourself that causes onlookers to overlook you entirely. You are not truly invisible—you simply slip from their conscious perception. You gain the benefits of invisibility against any creature with a mind. Creatures without minds (constructs, mindless undead) can still perceive you normally.

The effect ends if you attack, cast an offensive spell, or otherwise draw attention to yourself in a hostile manner. Creatures who have reason to be suspicious may attempt a Wisdom save to pierce the veil.

Or, at-will, std, concentration, 1 Vitae; you project a false appearance over yourself, appearing as a different creature of similar size and shape. You choose the appearance, which can include different clothing, features, species, and voice. Creatures who interact closely with you may attempt a Wisdom save to see through the disguise. If you attempt to impersonate a specific individual, creatures familiar with that person have advantage on the save.

At rank 2, you can extend your veil to cover allies within an emanation 1 per rank, at a cost of 1 additional Vitae per square of radius.

At rank 3, you can project your veil over an area (circle 5 per rank), making the entire area and everything in it appear different—as an empty room, a different location, or simply empty space. This costs 3 Vitae and requires concentration.


# Talents

- [Glimmer](#): When your veil is disrupted, it doesn't immediately disappear. Instead, for 1 round, you appear as a shimmering, indistinct figure, granting partial concealment (half cover) against attacks and advantage on Stealth checks. During this duration, you can spend a swift action to re-establish your veil without expending additional Vitae.
