brief: Orb of energy absorbs all heat in an area, causing cold effects and eventually exploding in a burst of ice
---

You create an orb of magical energy that absorbs all heat in an area, chilling the air and objects around it, before exploding in a burst of ice.

At-will, std, ranged, concentration, 3 Vitae; choose a square within range. An orb of cold energy appears there, hovering in space, absorbing heat from the area. In an emanation 3 (increasing by 2 squares per round if sustained), it causes the same effect as the emanation version of Chill Touch as you would cast it (minus the Vitae gain).

As soon as you stop concentrating on the orb, or at the start of your turn after 3 rounds of concentration, the orb explodes. All creatures in the radius suffer heavy cold damage for each round the orb was active, plus chilled (Con ends), or rooted if sustained for 2 rounds, or frozen if sustained for 3 rounds. All non-magical flames in the area are extinguished, and all water in the area freezes solid. Objects that are not being worn or carried become brittle, and have vulnerability to bludgeoning damage until the end of your next turn.
