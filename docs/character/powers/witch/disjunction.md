At-will, std, ranged, circle 5, 5 Vitae; you create a burst of antimagic energy that dispels all magical effects within the area, with no need to roll a dispel check. Additionally, all magic items within the area must pass a Cha save or become mundane until their wearer takes a short rest. If they critically fail the save, they permanently lose their magical traits. Creatures within the area lose 5 points of whatever energy they use to power their magical abilities (Vitae, Ki, Focus, etc.).
