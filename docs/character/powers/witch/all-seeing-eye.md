At-will, std, concentration, 3 Vitae; you manifest an invisible (or visible, if you prefer) floating eye in a target within visual range on the same planet. While you concentration, you can see through this eye as if you were in its space, and you can cast spells through it as if you were located there. 

The eye has a fly speed of 5 per rank, and HP equal to a heavy damage roll, with an AC of 15 + your spellcasting check bonus.

As a standard action while concentrating, you can teleport the eye to a new location within visual range on the same planet.

While concentrating, you can switch between seeing through the eye and your own vision as a free action once/rd. Your body remains under control, and you can act normally, but you are blind to your own surroundings while seeing through the eye.

# Talents
- [Tough to Crack](#): The All-Seeing Eye gains resistance to all damage types except force and radiant, as well as hardness equal to your proficiency bonus + casting ability score bonus.
