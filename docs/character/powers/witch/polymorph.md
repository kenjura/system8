At-will, std, concentration, 2 Vitae; change a creature's physical body. The new form can be another creature of similar size (within one size category), or a hybrid of their current form and such a creature. The subject retains its mental stats, alignment, and class features, but gains the physical stats, movement modes, natural attacks, and special qualities of the new form. The effect ends if you stop concentrating, or if willing subject spends a swift action to end it, or if an unwilling subject passes a Con save to end.

At rank 3, you gain finer control over the new form. You can add or subtract one or two limbs or wings, subtract facial features, change skin texture or color, and so on. You can lower physical ability scores as low as 2, and as high as 20 (increasing to 24 at rank 4 and 28 at rank 5). You can also make the duration last one day, without concentration (costs 3 Vitae).

At rank 4, you can change subject's size by 2 categories. You can also make the duration permanent (costs 4 Vitae).
