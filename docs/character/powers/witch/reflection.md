type: Defense
brief: Create a shield that reflects attacks and spells onto their originators
---

At-will, swift, concentration, 2 Vitae; you create a weightless magical shield with a mirror-like surface that you wield in one hand. Thereafter, you gain a reaction to any incoming targeted attack or spell against you. Roll a spellcasting check against the attack; on success, the attack does not affect you, and instead is reflected back at its originator, using your spellcasting roll result for AC or DC.


# Talents

- [Angle of Incidence](#): You can aim the reflected attack at a different target within range of the original attack, rather than the originator.
- [Mirrorwall](#): For 2 additional Vitae, the shield extends 1 square to either side of you, and above you. Your reflect reaction can protect all allies behind the shield, and can work against area effects.
