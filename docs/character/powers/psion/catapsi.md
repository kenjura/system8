brief: Psychic noise interferes with concentration and spellcasting.
---

At-will, swift, reserves 1 Focus; you create an emanation, of a radius you specify between 1 and 5 squares. Within this emanation, intense psychic noise interferes with all thinking minds, drowning out their own brain waves and making it difficult to concentrate on anything. It is especially effective against spellcasting.
- Roll a spellcasting skill check when manifesting this power. Creatures in the area who aren't you must beat that DC with a Concentration check when performing any complex mental action, such as casting a spell. If they fail this check, they lose the action; if they succeed, they can take it as normal.

At-will, std, close burst 5, expends 1 Focus; all active concentration effects are disrupted. Those effects whose DC is equal to or less than your spellcasting skill check are dispelled. Furthermore, all spellcasters in the vicinity who were not already concentrating on a spell are affected with Brain Lock, which has the same effect as normal Catapsi for the next spell they attempt to cast.
