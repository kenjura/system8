brief: Psychic noise interferes with concentration and spellcasting.
---

At-will, swift, focused, 2 mana; you create an emanation, of a radius you specify between 1 and 5 squares. Within this emanation, intense psychic noise interferes with all thinking minds, drowning out their own brain waves and making it difficult to concentrate on anything. It is especially effective against spellcasting.
- Roll a spellcasting skill check when manifesting this power. Creatures in the area who aren't you must beat that DC with a Concentration check when performing any complex mental action, such as casting a spell. If they fail this check, they lose the action; if they succeed, they can take it as normal.
