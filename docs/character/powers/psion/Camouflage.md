At-will, swift, requires Focus, 1 mana; you modify your body, modifying the light, sound, and odors emitted by your body.

You can use this for camouflage, gaining a +10 bonus to Stealth checks, by matching your visible exterior to the prevailing conditions around you, dampening sounds, and suppressing odors. This allows you to hide from Scent as well

At rank 2, this ability upgrades to make you invisible (a la Predator stealth).

You can also use this ability to disguise your features, obscuring your identity, or even assuming the identity of someone else (who is approximately the same shape and size as you).
