While focused, your unarmed attacks inflict heavy lethal bludgeoning damage, and can be used to parry lethal weapons. Additionally, you may apply one [Weapon Enhancement](../../equipments/weapons#weapon-enhancements) of your choice of the same rank as your Psion rank. You may change the enhancement as a swift action.
