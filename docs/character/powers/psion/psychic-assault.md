# Psychic Assault

You can harm the minds of creatures with telepathic force.

## Rank 1
- Mind Thrust: at-will, std, ranged, 1 Mana; heavy psychic damage (Wis half), plus disadvantage to the next Int, Wis, or Cha roll made by the subject.
- Overload: Amygdala: at-will, std, ranged, 1 Mana, concentration; subject loses the ability distinguish between threats real and imagined, and cannot filter their emotions from their mind. They suffer the *frightened* condition (Wis ends).
- Overload: Broca: at-will, std, ranged, 1 Mana, concentration; subject's language ability is overloaded, leading them to be unable to form meaningful words. They are unable to use verbal components for spells or say anything intelligible, regardless of the language capacity of whoever is listening to them. Wis negates each round.


## Rank 2
- Mind Flay: at-will, std, ranged, 2 Mana, concentration; subject suffers heavy psychic damage on turn start (Wis half), plus disadvantage to all checks for one chosen ability score: Int, Wis, or Cha.
- Overload: Hippocampus: at-will, std, ranged, 2 Mana, concentration; subject's memory system overloads, causing them to suffer extreme confusion and amnesia. Each round, they cannot choose their actions if they fail a Wisdom check, but rather they are determined randomly (see *Confusion*).
- Overload: Thalamus: at-will, std, ranged, 1 Mana, concentration; subject sensory apparatus overloads, and they see, hear, and feel an overwhelming number of sensations of impossible intensity, all at once. They suffer the *blind*, *deaf*, and *wracked* conditions (Wis ends each).

## Rank 3
- Mind Blast: recharge 33%, std, cone 4, 3 Mana; heavy psychic damage (Wis half) plus stunned (Wis ends).
- Overload: Medulla: at-will, std, ranged, 3 Mana, concentration; subject's autonomic systems fail--they stop breathing, their heart stops beating, and their motor control ceases. Each round, if the subject fails their Con save, they enter the *incapacitated* state. If they were already in that state, they instead enter the *unconscious* state. If they were already in that state, they instead enter the *dying* state. If they are already dying, they automatically fail their death save on your turn, without a Con save.
