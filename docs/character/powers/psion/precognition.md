You sense things before they occur.

At-will, reaction to an incoming harmful effect, 1 Mana; you take a single chosen move or swift action which helps you avoid or mitigate the effect.
- At rank 2, you can spend 2 Mana to use a standard action instead.

At-will, std, 1 Mana; you prognosticate the near future, considering a single proposed course of action, such as "what if I open the left door instead of the right?". Through the power of precognition, you receive a barrage of visions of possible outcomes, which boil down to "good outcome", "bad outcome", "mixture of good and bad", or "neither good nor bad". The course of action is something that should fit within the next hour or so. Seeing further into the future is too difficult at this rank.
