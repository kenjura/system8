At-will, std, melee or ranged (30 ft); you project a telekinetic force to shove a target creature or object. If they pass a Str save against your psionic power DC, they resist the effect, moving only 5-ft. Otherwise, they are pushed 5 squares per rank away from you (or toward you, if you prefer).

You can target an object held by a creature, in which case the creature rolls the Strength check to nullify the effect.

If you push the target into a hard or dangerous surface, they suffer heavy bludgeoning damage (adjust type based on what they struck). You can push the target into a second target, but must meet that target's AC with your spellcasting result to hit them. If so, split the damage between the two targets equally.

After manifesting this power, gain 1 Focus.
