At-will, swift; you compress the space around you, allowing you to move up to your normal movement speed, plus your Int bonus, as a swift action. This movement is so fast that it does not provoke opportunity attacks. After you move, you gain 1 Focus.

At rank 2, you move so quickly that gravity does not have a chance to affect you during this movement. As long as the start and end squares are on solid ground, you can move over any terrain (including water or air) without falling or sinking during the movement.

At rank 3, you can use this ability even if you are immobilized or restrained, as long as you have at least 1 square of movement available.

At rank 4, this movement is so fast that the electromagnetic force and the Pauli Exclusion Principle don't have a chance to stop you. You can pass through solid objects up to 1 inch thick without harm. You must end your movement in an unoccupied square on the other side of the object.
