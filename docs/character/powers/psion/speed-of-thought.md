At-will, move, requires focus, 1 mana; you compress the space in front of you, then move through it at otherwise normal speed. You can move up to your normal base movement speed in a straight line, but the movement is conducted virtually instantaneously.

You do physically traverse the distance, so you cannot teleport past a wall that you couldn't walk through. The compression is linear, so you couldn't curve your path around an obstacle. At every point along the route, there must be enough space for you to occupy, so you couldn't travel through a narrow tube smaller than your head, or a barred prison wall, even if enough room existed on the other side.

However, other physical considerations can be ignored during your traversal. Since the travel is instant, gravity has no time to affect you. You could travel from one stable platform to another, even if there was a chasm in between. In fact, your destination also does not have to offer stable footing--if you arrive in a space with no floor, you will fall once arriving there.

Since the movement is instantaneous, it does not trigger any attacks of opportunity, nor trigger any floor-based traps such as pressure plates or symbols. Treat it as if you took a single very long stride, without your feet making contact with any intervening squares.

For +1 mana you can double the range of the movement.
