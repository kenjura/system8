At-will, swift, concentration; you levitate off the ground, able to move upward 1 square with 1 square of your movement. If you are still within reach of the ground, you can walk normally; otherwise, horizontal movement costs double (2 squares of movement per square moved). You can descend at any time without using movement. The maximum height you can reach is equal to your base move.

At rank 2, you gain a fly speed equal to your walking speed. Meaning, horizontal movement no longer costs double, and you have no height limit. By expending 1 Focus, you can increase your fly speed by 200% for 1 minute.

At rank 3, you can slot 2 Focus instead of 1 to gain +200% fly speed without expending. If you expend 2 Focus, you can increase your fly speed to 10x for 10 minutes.

At rank 4, you can slot 3 Focus to gain 10x fly speed without expending. If you expend 3 Focus, you can increase your fly speed to 50x for 1 hour.

At rank 5, you can slot 4 Focus to gain 50x fly speed without expending. If you expend 4 Focus, you can increase your fly speed to 250x for 8 hours.
