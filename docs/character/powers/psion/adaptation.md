Expend 1 Focus to gain immunity to your resisted energy type for 1 round."

At-will, swift, concentration; you modify your body, such that you are inured to extreme environments that might otherwise be harmful.

When you activate this ability, choose one of the benefits below. You can also change which one is active as a swift action.
- You are resistant to heat, gaining Resist 50% (fire damage). In temperatures up to the extreme edge of survivability for your species, you are comfortable. For humans, about 140°F or 60°C.
- You are resistant to cold, gaining Resist 50% (frost damage). In temperatures as low as the extreme edge of survivability for your species, you are comfortable. For humans, about -40°.
- You are resistant to underwater environments, gaining the ability to breathe underwater, a swim speed equal to your walking speed, and immunity to the effects of pressure up to 1,000 feet.
- You are resistant to vacuum, gaining the ability to store up to one hour's worth of excess oxygen inside your body, and ignoring the deleterious effects of the vacuum itself. This also renders you immune to poisonous gases.
- You are resistant to lightning, gaining Resist 50% (lightning damage).
- You are resistant to acid, gaining Resist 50% (acid damage).

If you expend Focus, you can become immune to one energy type for 1 round.

You can "slot" multiple Focus points to gain multiple benefits simultaneously.
