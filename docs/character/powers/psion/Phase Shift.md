At-will, swift, concentration, 2 mana; you shift your body out of phase with the Material Plane, and partially into one of the Transitive Planes. You remain visible, but become incorporeal. Physical matter and energy does not interact with your body (mostly; see below), nor can you interact with anything physical. 

You can still move as normal in these planes, although the density of energy and matter in the Material Plane affects your movement. Gases at normal atmospheric pressure present no more barrier than they otherwise would. Liquids as dense as water slow your movement by 50%. Solid matter slows you considerably:
- You can phase through a wall consisting of wood, plaster, and other natural buildings typical to indoor buildings by expending 15 feet of movement.
- You can slowly force your way through solid earth (soil, clay, sand, anything but bedrock) by expending a full move action per 5 feet.
- You can attempt to push your way through solid stone or metal by passing a spellcasting skill check, DC 15, to move 5 feet for one move action. If you fail, you make no progress, and failure by 10 or more means you shunt 5 feet toward the nearest non-solid space. The DC increases by 5 feet for each 5 feet into a solid surface that you move.

As a swift action, you can phase back into the Material Plane. This does not end the effect unless you wish it to. You can keep swapping in and out. When you stop concentrating, you are shunted back into the Material Plane.
