# Electrokinesis

You control the Electromagnetic Force, allowing you to control electricity and magnetism.

## Rank 1
- Magnetize: at-will, std, concentration; target metal object becomes highly magnetized. Any other ferrous objects within 1 square are attracted to or repelled by it.
  - If unattended, they simply move. Attracted objects cling to the target, while repelled objects fly away (push 3).
  - If attended, the wielder can either let go, or fight the effect (Str negates each round). While under the influence of magnetism, a held object (such as a weapon) has disadvantage to attacks.
  - If the target is a suit of metal armor, you can make it stick to itself by varying the magnetic charge on different pieces. This causes the subject to suffer a 50% movement penalty.
- Static Charge: at-will, swift; you build up an electrical charge on your body. Thereafter, you can release it along with a touch attack, a metal melee weapon attack, or upon physical contact with any other creature or object (such as when a creature hits you with a natural weapon). When released, it causes heavy lightning damage.
  - For 1 Mana, you can add a stun to this effect. Subject suffers stunned for 1 rd (Con negates).
- Lightning Strike: at-will, std, ranged; medium lightning damage.
  - For 1 Mana, you can increase the damage to heavy.
  - For 0 Mana, you can reduce the damage to none, but add a stun for 1 rd (Con negates).

## Rank 2
- Chain Lightning: at-will, std, ranged, 2 Mana; medium lightning damage, plus chains to up to 2 extra targets with jumps up to 3 squares. For 1 Mana, you can add a jump.
- Lightning Shield: at-will, swift, concentration; you can activate a Static Charge that continuously refreshes as an immediate action. Each time it goes off, you spend 1 Mana.
- Magnetokinesis: at-will, std, ranged, concentration; telekinetically move a ferrous object of medium size or smaller up to 6 squares per round. Other uses:
  - For 1 Mana, you can thrust the target, ending the effect. You push or pull it 5 squares, and, if aimed at a target, it inflicts medium bludgeoning damage (or heavy if it's particularly dangerous, sharp, etc). +1 Mana for +5 squares.
  - For 2 Mana, you can use this on a Large target. At rank 3, you can spend 4 to use it on a Huge target. Etc

## Rank 3
- Ionizing Bolt: at-will, std, ranged, 3 Mana; heavy lightning damage, plus target gains lightning vulnerability 100%.
- Tesla Coil: at-will, std, emanation 3, 3 Mana, concentration; enemies suffer medium lightning damage each round.
