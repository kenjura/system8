At-will, swift, requires Focus; you gather psychic energy in the form of a weapon with which you are proficient. While it is made of energy (exact aesthetics are up to you), it has the normal traits for said weapon.

By expending Focus, you can augment a single strike significantly. Choose one:
- Burst o'flame
- Shocking zappy
- Freezy chilly
- Forceful Push
- etc...
