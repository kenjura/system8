# Mindlink

The telepathic ability to link your mind to another's, allowing to read their thoughts, plant suggestions, etc.


## Rank 1
- Telepathic Bond: at-will, swift, ranged, concentration, 0 Mana; establish a telepathic bond with a creature you can see. Both of you can speak freely to the other, even if you do not share a language.
- Detect Minds: at-will, swift, cone 5, concentration, 0 Mana; while you concentrate, you sense the presence of minds in the area, regardless of cover or concealment. You must close your eyes while using this sense, as otherwise the psychic sense is drowned out by your visual stimulus. As soon as you use this ability, you can detect the presence or absensce of thinking minds in the area (besides your own). If you spend a standard action to focus on the area, you can detect the number of minds, and their relative intelligence (animal, human, superhuman). If you spend another standard action on the same area, you can pinpoint the location of each mind.
  - For +1 Mana, add +5 to the area
- Read Thoughts: see Detect Thoughts in 5e.


## Rank 2
- Detect Minds
  - Can be used in an emanation 5
  - You detect the number of minds immediately, without spending a std action
- Memory Reading: deep mind probing
- Suggestion: at-will, std, ranged, 2 Mana; you implant a suggestion in the subject's mind, stated as a single-clause sentence (e.g. "you should throw your weapons in that pit" or "your allies are enemes in disguise"). Within the DM's adjudication, the subject acts independently to fulfill the suggestion (Wis ends). If the suggestion is unreasonable or poorly-justified (such as "you should kill your best friend"), they gain advantage to the saving throw.
  - Optionally, you may concentrate on this effect, causing them to have to save each round.


## Rank 3
- Detect Minds
  - No need to close your eyes
- Inception?
- Memory Alteration




## Feats
- [Mindsight](#): You can activate or deactivate Detect Minds as a free action, without concentration.
