# Mindlink

Base level: link two minds together so you can telepathically communicate.

Advanced uses: share mental abilities (like spells and knowledge), reinforce each others' mental saving throws, combat each others' mental effects, share the burden of psychic damage, etc. Also, link more than 2 minds in a network.

# Steal Focus

At-will, std, ranged; you telepathically siphon Focus from a target within range. If they are currently concentrating on a power, they must pass a Cha save against your DC, or else lose concentration. If not, they must pass the same save the next time they attempt to concentrate, within 3 rounds. Either way, you gain 1 Focus.
