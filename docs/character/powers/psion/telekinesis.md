At-will, swift, concentration, 0 mana; you gain telekinetic control of a medium or smaller creature or object. Thereafter, you may do the following:
- As a standard action, you may move the object slowly, up to 6 squares. This movement isn't fast enough to cause harm.
- As a standard action, for 1 mana, you may forcefully thrust the subject, pushing them 10 squares. If they strike an unyielding surface, they suffer heavy bludgeoning damage. If the surface is yielding (e.g. another creature), they split the damage evenly. To strike a secondary target that is capable of defense, you must "aim" the primary target, using your spellcasting skill check as a ranged attack vs AC.
- As a standard action, you can telekinetically crush the target, inflicting medium crushing damage.

The subject is allowed a Strength save each round to end the effect. While telekinetically controlled, their overall mass is suspended in space and moves as you direct. However, they retain fine control of their body, such as limb movement, so they are not rendered helpless.
- If they are able to reach a surface to push or pull against, they can contest your telekinetic movement. In this case, they gain advantage to their Strength save to end the effect.
- They can make attacks with weapons they have at hand, and can use powers. They can freely speak or use other natural communication.

At higher ranks, you can enhance this power:
- At rank 2, you can lift a Large object or creature by expending 1 mana. At rank 3, the limit is Huge, and costs 2 mana. Etc.
