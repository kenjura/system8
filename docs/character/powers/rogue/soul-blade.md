# Soul Blade

In a 10-minute ritual requiring your blood (inflicts 1d4 damage), you bind your soul to a weapon, granting it the ability to steal vitality from your enemies. When you hit an enemy with a melee attack using this weapon, you gain 1 [Vitae](../../classes/witch#vitae). This has uses described below.

Now that you have Vitae, you can spend future powers to gain powers from the [Witch](../../classes/witch) class.


# Steal Vitality

At-will, std, melee attack; you make a normal melee attack (can be a sneak attack) with your Soul Blade. If you inflict damage, you gain 1 Vitae. If you critically hit or sneak attack, you gain an additional 1 Vitae. If you do both, you gain an additional 2 Vitae.


# Death Attack

At-will, std, 1 Vitae, melee attack, must be a Sneak Attack; you strike with your weapon, imbuing the attack with necrotic energy. You inflict bonus necrotic damage equal to your critical bonus damage.

Example:
- Your dagger inflicts 1d4+2 damage, but on a crit, inflicts 100% of that as critical bonus damage (1d4+2). With this ability, you would inflict 1d4+2 additional necrotic damage.

# Void Strike

At-will, std, 1 Vitae, melee attack, must be a sneak attack; you imbue your weapon with antimagic and strike at your foe. If you inflict damage, you may attempt to dispel one ongoing magical effect on the subject of your choice. If the AC you hit exceeds the spell's DC, you succeed.
