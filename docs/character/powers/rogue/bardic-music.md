# Inspiring Melody

Encounter, swift, close burst 10; allies hear your song and are inspired to greatness.

Each ally gains one token, which can be applied as they please to any single d20 roll during the encounter.

Applying the token improves the roll by 1d6 (increasing to 1d8 at rank 2, 1d10 at rank 3, etc).

This not only increases the result, but can also create critical success (for example, rolling a 16 naturally, then rolling 4 or higher on the inspiration, would count as a natural 20).


# Fascinating Performance

Encounter, swift, close burst 10; your performance captivates your audience, causing them to be charmed by you.

Roll a Charisma check; subjects in the area are fascinated (unable to take actions other than to watch and listen to you) while you concentrate and continue to perform (Wis ends). 

Subjects who are aware of a possible threat cannot be affected. Subjects already in combat cannot be affected.

Affected subjects are instantly freed of the effect if they take damage or suffer a debilitation.


# The Power of Suggestion
Requires rank 2.

While Fascinating Performance is active, you can spend a standard action to make a suggestion to the fascinated subjects. It must be reasonable harmless, such as "follow me", or "everybody clap". Anything that a normal, not-fascinated person who was otherwise interested in your performance would consider dangerous or repugnant automatically fails (e.g. "give me all your money" or "punch yourself in the face"). 

Subjects follow reasonable suggestions until they pass a Wis save to end; on success, they are still fascinated. You can't have two suggestions active at once; making a new one ends the previous one.


# Reveille
Requires rank 3.

Encounter, swift, close burst 10; your performance revitalizes your allies, giving them a burst of energy and courage. Each ally is allowed to draw up to 100% of their max HP from their [Reserve Hit Points](/character/basics/reserve-hit-points). For one round, they gain advantage to all saving throws.


# Inspire Greatness
Requires rank 4.

Encounter, swift, close burst 10; your performance inspires your allies to heroic heights, giving them a brief burst of action. Allies gain an additional standard and swift action, and an additional reaction, on their next turn.


# Song of Valor
Requires rank 5.

Encounter, reaction to an ally dying or going to 0 HP; when an ally falls in battle, you can sing a song of their bravery that is so moving, the gods grant them a second chance at life. The ally is restored to 1 HP.
