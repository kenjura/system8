# Steal Spell
Starting at 3rd level, you gain the most defining ability of a Spellthief: the ability to steal spells.

At-will, standard action, melee range; you attempt to steal a spell from the subject. Subject must have the ability to cast spells. Roll a Dexterity check, opposed to the enemy's Wisdom save. On success, you steal a random spell the subject can cast, that is of a rank equal to your own. On failure, nothing happens.

When you steal a spell, you gain a single, consumable use of that spell, exactly as described. You may use it any time before the next long rest; if not used by then, it fades away.

## Choosing a spell
Normally, the spell stolen is determined randomly by the DM, from among all available spells of the designated level the subject has available. 

However, if you know what spells the subject has (perhaps by casting [[Scan]], or having observed a spell being cast by the subject), you can "call" a specific spell before rolling your check. If you succeed, you steal that specific spell. 

## Drain Item

You can target a non-consumable magic item, draining one of its magical powers. If it has charges, you drain 1.


# Spell Mastery

Whenever you steal a spell, it becomes a candidate for Spell Mastery. When you select powers at future levels, you can choose any power you have previously stolen and cast. You gain the energy type needed to cast that spell.
