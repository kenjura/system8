# Cloak of Shadows

Encounter, reaction; you cloak yourself in shadows. For a brief moment, you become one with the void, vanishing from sight and phasing beyond the ability of enemies to harm you. Roll a Dex save against one incoming attack or power; if you succeed, you become untargetable, avoiding it entirely. This can also be used against an active ongoing effect.

At rank 2, the cooldown changes to recharge 33%.

# Meld into Shadows

At-will, swift, concentration, must in dimness or darkness; you meld into the shadows, becoming invisible. If you take an attack, use a power, or suffer damage, you become visible.

# Shadow Step

Recharge 33%, move, must be in dimness or darkness; you step into the shadows, teleporting up to your base movement rate to another location also in dimness or darkness.

At rank 2, you can use this power once per encounter without being in dimness or darkness.

At rank 3, the cooldown changes to at-will (in dimness or darkness).

# Absorb Light
Requires rank 2.

Recharge 33%, swift, concentration, close burst 10; all light levels in the area decrease by one step (daylight -> well-lit, well-lit -> dimness, dimness -> darkness). This affects all light effects existing at the time you manifest the power, as well as any new ones that arise during the duration.

At rank 3, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to a medium damage roll when you manifest this power and it intersects any daylight.

At rank 4, you decrease light by 2 levels.

At rank 5, the cooldown changes to at-will.
