# Psychic Focus

You gain 1 [Focus](../../classes/psion#focus), which can be used to maintain concentration without using your normal concentration slot.

Now that you have Focus, you can spend future powers to gain powers from the [Psion](../../classes/psion) class.

# Psiblade

At-will, swift, concentration; you manifest a psychic blade made of pure mental energy. The blade is a magical weapon that you can use to attack enemies. When you hit an enemy with the psiblade, the enemy takes medium psychic damage, as well as disadvantage to the next Int, Wis, or Cha roll (your choice) that the target takes within 3 rounds.

On a critical hit (or sneak attack), you inflict a greater effect: either [Feebleminded](../../conditions/feebleminded), [Meek](../../conditions/meek), or [Addled](../../conditions/addled) (your choice) to the target for 1 round per Rogue rank.

## Psi-enhanced Blade

As an alternative to manifesting a blade of pure energy, you can imbue psychic power into a physical weapon.

At-will, swift, concentration; you imbue a held weapon with psychic power. The damage gains the psychic damage type, and inflicts the same debilitation effect as the [Psiblade](#psiblade).
