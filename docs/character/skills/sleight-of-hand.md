# Sleight of Hand

Sleight of Hand covers acts of manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else, concealing an object on your person, or picking pockets.

## How to Roll

**Sleight of Hand = d20 + Dexterity modifier + Proficiency (if proficient)**

This is often contested by the target's Perception.

## Common Uses

### Pick Pockets
Steal a small item from someone without them noticing. Contested by their passive Perception.

### Plant an Item
Place an item on someone or in their belongings without detection.

### Conceal an Item
Hide a small object on your person so it won't be found during a search.
- **DC 10**: Conceal a very small item (coin, key)
- **DC 15**: Conceal a small item (dagger, pouch)
- **DC 20**: Conceal a larger item (short sword, small book)

### Palm an Object
Pick up or switch an object without observers noticing.

### Perform Manual Tricks
Card tricks, coin manipulation, or other demonstrations of dexterity.
