# Acrobatics

Acrobatics covers your ability to stay on your feet in tricky situations, perform flips and rolls, and maintain balance on precarious surfaces.

## How to Roll

**Acrobatics = d20 + Dexterity modifier + Proficiency (if proficient)**

## Common Uses

### Balance
Move across narrow or unstable surfaces without falling. The DC depends on the surface:
- **DC 10**: A wide ledge or slightly slippery floor
- **DC 15**: A narrow beam or rope
- **DC 20**: A tightrope or very narrow ledge
- **DC 25+**: An extremely narrow or unstable surface

### Tumble
Move through an enemy's space or avoid attacks of opportunity by rolling or flipping past them.

### Escape Grapples
Use Acrobatics instead of Athletics to slip out of a grapple, using your agility rather than brute strength.

### Reduce Falling Damage
Make an Acrobatics check to land safely and reduce falling damage. DC 15 to reduce damage by half, DC 20 to reduce by 75%.

## Proficiency Benefits
- **Evasion**: When you would take half damage on a successful Dexterity save, you instead take no damage.

## Expertise Benefits
- **Tumble**: You can move through enemy spaces without provoking opportunity attacks.

## Mastery Benefits
- **Extended Reach**: Your acrobatic maneuvers extend your effective reach in combat.
