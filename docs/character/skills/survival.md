### Track
Follow a creature's trail. The DC depends on the terrain and conditions:

- **DC 20**: Hard ground, very old tracks, or quarry that's trying to hide
- **DC 25+**: Stone, ancient tracks, or a quarry using magic to hide

### Forage
Find food and water in the wild. DC varies by terrain:
- **DC 10**: Abundant food and water (forest, jungle)
- **DC 15**: Moderate resources (plains, coast)
- **DC 20**: Scarce resources (desert, arctic)

### Navigate
Find your way through wilderness without getting lost.

### Predict Weather
Anticipate weather changes for the next 24 hours (DC 15).
