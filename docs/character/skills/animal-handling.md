## How to Roll

**Animal Handling = d20 + Wisdom modifier + Proficiency (if proficient)**

## Common Uses

### Calm an Animal
Soothe a frightened or agitated animal. The DC depends on the animal's state and temperament.
- **DC 10**: A nervous but domesticated animal
- **DC 15**: A spooked horse or frightened dog
- **DC 20**: A panicked or aggressive animal
- **DC 25+**: A wild or hostile creature

### Control a Mount
Keep your mount under control in dangerous situations, such as during combat or when crossing difficult terrain.

### Train an Animal
Teach an animal a trick or command. This typically requires extended downtime and multiple successful checks.

### Intuit Animal Intentions
Read an animal's body language to understand its mood, intentions, or what it might be reacting to.

## Proficiency Benefits
- You can attempt to handle exotic or magical beasts.
- Your mount gains advantage on saves against being frightened while you ride it.

## Expertise Benefits
- You can command your mount as a free action instead of a bonus action.
- Animals you've trained can perform more complex commands.

## Mastery Benefits
- You can communicate basic concepts with animals, even without magic.
- Wild animals are initially indifferent to you rather than hostile.
