# Deception

Deception determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, whether through verbal misdirection, disguise, or other trickery.

## How to Roll

**Deception = d20 + Charisma modifier + Proficiency (if proficient)**

Deception is typically contested by the target's Insight.

## Common Uses

### Lie
Tell a falsehood convincingly. The DC or contested check depends on how plausible the lie is:
- **Advantage**: The lie is believable and doesn't affect the target much
- **Normal**: The lie is plausible but the target has reason to be suspicious
- **Disadvantage**: The lie is outlandish or the target has strong reason to doubt you

### Fast Talk
Distract or confuse someone with a rapid stream of words, buying time or creating an opening.

### Disguise Intentions
Hide your true motives in a conversation or negotiation.

### Create a Diversion
Draw attention away from something or someone.

### Feint
In combat, use Deception to create an opening against an opponent (typically as part of a specific combat maneuver).

## Proficiency Benefits
- You can maintain a lie even under pressure or scrutiny.
- You can create convincing cover stories with minimal preparation.

## Expertise Benefits
- You can lie even when magically compelled to tell the truth (contested check vs. spell DC).
- Your disguises are nearly undetectable without magic.

## Mastery Benefits
- You can read what someone wants to hear and tailor your lies accordingly.
- You gain advantage on Deception checks against creatures who don't know you.
