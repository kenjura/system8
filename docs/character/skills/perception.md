# Perception

Perception lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses.

## How to Roll

**Perception = d20 + Wisdom modifier + Proficiency (if proficient)**

**Passive Perception = 10 + Wisdom modifier + Proficiency (if proficient)**

Your Passive Perception is used when you're not actively searching but might notice something anyway.
