# Intimidation

Intimidation is used when you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, or physical menace.

## How to Roll

**Intimidation = d20 + Charisma modifier + Proficiency (if proficient)**

Some DMs may allow Strength-based Intimidation for physical threats.

## Common Uses

### Threaten
Coerce someone into doing what you want through fear. The DC depends on the target's courage and how credible your threat is:
- **DC 10**: A timid creature or a very credible threat
- **DC 15**: An average person or a believable threat
- **DC 20**: A brave individual or a questionable threat
- **DC 25+**: A fearless creature or an empty threat

### Demoralize
Shake an enemy's confidence in combat, potentially imposing disadvantage or the frightened condition.

### Interrogate
Extract information from a captive or unwilling subject through fear.

### Display Dominance
Establish yourself as the alpha in a social situation, causing others to defer to you.

### Stare Down
Win a contest of wills through sheer force of personality.

## Proficiency Benefits
- You can attempt to frighten creatures as a bonus action in combat.
- Your threats are taken seriously even by those who don't know you.

## Expertise Benefits
- Creatures you've successfully intimidated have disadvantage on attacks against you for 1 round.
- You can intimidate creatures that are normally immune to fear (with a higher DC).

## Mastery Benefits
- You can intimidate multiple creatures at once without penalty.
- Your mere presence can cause weaker creatures to flee.
