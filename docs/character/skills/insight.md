# Insight

Insight determines whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone's next move.

## How to Roll

**Insight = d20 + Wisdom modifier + Proficiency (if proficient)**

Insight is typically used to contest Deception or to read someone's general demeanor.

## Common Uses

### Detect Lies
Sense whether someone is being truthful. This is typically a contested check against their Deception.

### Read Intentions
Determine what someone wants, fears, or is planning. The DC depends on how well they're hiding it:
- **DC 10**: Obvious emotional state (anger, fear, joy)
- **DC 15**: Subtle cues or hidden nervousness
- **DC 20**: Well-concealed intentions
- **DC 25+**: A skilled deceiver or someone with no emotional tells

### Sense Motive
Understand why someone is acting a certain way, even if they're not lying.

### Predict Behavior
Anticipate what someone is likely to do next based on their personality and current situation.

### Assess Trustworthiness
Get a gut feeling about whether someone can be trusted.

## Proficiency Benefits
- You can use Insight to contest Deception as a reaction.
- You gain a bonus to initiative against creatures you've observed for at least 1 minute.

## Expertise Benefits
- You can sense when someone is under magical compulsion or charm.
- You gain advantage on saves against being deceived or manipulated.

## Mastery Benefits
- You automatically detect obvious lies.
- You can read surface thoughts through careful observation (similar to a weak Detect Thoughts).
