# Stealth

Stealth is used when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.

## How to Roll

**Stealth = d20 + Dexterity modifier + Proficiency (if proficient)**

This is typically contested by the observer's Perception or passive Perception.

## Common Uses

### Hide
Conceal yourself from view. You must have something to hide behind or within, and you can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly.

### Move Silently
Move without making noise. Your Stealth check is contested by listeners' Perception.

### Follow Undetected
Shadow someone without them noticing you.

### Ambush
Set up an attack from hiding. If you succeed, you gain surprise and/or advantage on your first attack.

### Avoid Detection
Move through an area without alerting guards, monsters, or other observers.

## Modifiers
- **Advantage**: Heavy obscurement, lots of ambient noise, distracted observers
- **Disadvantage**: Light obscurement only, very quiet environment, alert observers
- **Armor Penalty**: Heavy armor imposes disadvantage on Stealth checks

## Proficiency Benefits
- You can attempt to hide as a bonus action.
- You can move at normal speed while hiding without penalty.

## Expertise Benefits
- You can hide even with only light obscurement.
- You can hide in combat even if you've been seen, if you break line of sight.

## Mastery Benefits
- You can hide in plain sight if there's any shadow or cover at all.
- Creatures searching for you have disadvantage on their Perception checks.
