Other variants can be learned later, like:

## Oathkeeper

Each Oath is optional. You don't have to take any of them. Each of them comes with substantial roleplaying limitations and associated benefits.

Vow      | Limitations | Benefit
---------|-------------|--------
Purity | No drugs, no sex, nothing fun. | Resist poison and disease.
Protection | Must not ever allow innocents to come to harm, even in the face of overwhelming force. | Defensive bonuses
Courage | Must never flee from battle, turn down a righteous quest, etc | Immune to fear

etc...


## Sin Sight

You can detect extraplanar creatures, undead, and other creatures with an inherently magical nature.

When looking at mortals, you can see the weight of their sins upon them.


## Aura

* [Aura of Menace](#): evildoers are afraid of you.
* [Aura of Protection](#): allies gain bonuses to defense.
* [Aura of Zeal](#): move faster.

etc...

(not at-will; you have to spend mana, but the effects are strong)



## Holy Light
