1     | Mind over Body, Talents



## Abilities

### Mind Over Body
Your physical abilities are augmented by your mental ones.
- Your Strength is increased by your Charisma bonus.
- Your Dexterity is increased by your Intelligence bonus.
- Your Constitution is increased by your Wisdom bonus.

All of these bonuses are capped by your current Monk level.



## Focus
Through meditation, you can achieve a state of Focus, whereby you are fully in tune with the present moment, your mind is perfectly synced with your body, and you are in a state of mental and physical perfection. This has a number of benefits, mostly determined by your talent selections. Some abilities "slot" Focus, reserving a point or more to enable a continuous ability. Others deplete your Focus pool.

As you train in this discipline, your capacity for Focus yet increases. Your maximum Focus is given below:

Level | Max Focus
------|----------
1-2   | 1
3-5   | 2
6-9   | 3
10-14 | 4
15-20 | 5

It takes time spent in meditation to restore lost Focus; you regain all Focus during a short rest.
