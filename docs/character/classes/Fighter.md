You gain the 1st ability of the style right away. On your next level up, you gain the next ability, etc, until all are gained.


### Assault
Level | Maneuver
------|---------
1     | Charge
2     | Slam
3     | Rend
4     | Overpower
5     | Execute

- Charge: at-will, std; move up to twice base movement in a straight line, minimum 2 squares; gain advantage to attack or damage roll.
- Slam: at-will, std, provokes an attack of opportunity; make a melee attack that inflicts +50% damage.
- Rend: recharge 33%, augments a melee attack; attack inflicts half damage on turn start for 3 rounds.
- Overpower: recharge 33%, std; normal melee attack, but the enemy is not allowed to use parry or block.
- Execute: recharge 33%, std, enemy must be below 50% health; normal attack +100% damage.

### Protection
Level | Benefit
------|--------
1     | Defensive Stance
2     | Taunt
3     | Revenge
4     | Intervene
5     | I Am Your Shield


- Defensive Stance: when enemies make attacks against allies who are within your melee reach, you can use your own Parry or Block against them. You gain an additional reaction each round to be used for any Parry or Block attempt.
- Taunt: taunt
- Revenge: when you or an ally within melee range takes damage, keep track of it. At any time within one round, you may add this damage to a successful attack you make against the instigator of that damage. You may only have one such "token" active at a time. If another opportunity arrives before you use your token, you can keep the one you have, or accept the new one in its place.
- Intervene: recharge 33%, reaction to an ally being attacked; you move up to your base movement speed, interposing yourself to suffer an attack in place of an ally.
- I Am Your Shield: allies within your melee reach can use you as cover. When doing so, 50% of damage they take from area effects is suffered by you instead of them, and there is a 50% chance any attack targeted directly at them hits you instead.

- Quick Hands: you can draw, sheathe, or reload a ranged weapon as a swift action.
- Multi Shot: recharge 33%, std; fire one shot at each of three targets within a cone.
- Precise Shot: you can use your Aim "token" for other purposes besides advantage to attack rolls, such as:
  - Deadly Shot: instead of advantage to attack, gain advantage to damage roll
  - Wing Clip: your attack causes 50% movement reduction (Con ends)
  - Concussive Shot: your attack caused *dazed* (lose move and swift actions) (Con ends)
