## Felicity

Felicity is the ability of a witch to attune her body to the natural flow of magic. Thus attuned, her very body becomes her instrument of magic. Her touch channels energy, her eye peers into the divine, and her words are laced with power.

Choose one of these abilities for each odd level.

# UNOFFICIAL OLD CRAP
## Hedgecraft

There is power in all things: claws of the tiger, eye of the newt, blossom of the lily. And Thaumaturgists know how to harness the power inherent in all natural things. Sometimes, yes, this involves a cauldron, but there really are many more ways of working this ancient magic.




## Covens

A "coven" is a circle of trust. It can be a formal organization, but it can just as well be a network of associates sharing knowledge and power.

In game terms, you gain a new coven according to the level chart. In-character, you must prove adherence to an ethos, and only then will the secrets be shared with you. Your use of those secrets is forever bound to your promise to uphold that ethos.

# Dev Notes

Witch magic should be:
- Abjuration
- Divination
- Enchantment
- Illusion
- Necromancy
- Transmutation

And that's it. And all of it should be thaumaturgical. Thus:
- No "charm person". Rather, love potions, pheromones, etc
- No Power Word: Shield. Rather, a shield bracelet, a potion of barkskin, etc
- You don't just make a broom animated by saying words--you imbue it with your blood, your essence.
