# Vitae

Types:
- Blood
- Elemental
- Soul

There are ways of gathering each. The more you have of a given type, the more side effects it causes.

## Blood

Vitae of the Blood is the energy of life. It is not that literal blood has energy, but rather blood is sympathetically linked to the life energy of the being to which it belongs. Blood from a dead creature, or blood that has been separated long enough to cool, bears little to no vital energy.

You can gain Blood Vitae by letting blood--either yours or someone else's. The blood of others becomes symbolically yours by the act of either being offered it (in the case of an ally), or taking it unwilling, such as when attacking a creature.

Blood Vitae has the effect of intensifying your most primeval instincts. A modest amount will energize you, readying you to fight or flee, alerting your senses, etc. A large amount will agonize your hunger, intensify your fear, and send your heart racing as life becomes too much.

# Talents

More to come.

## Felicity

### Clarity
- [Weavesight](#): You can detect magical auras precisely and accurately on sight, without spending multiple rounds concentration.
- [Anti-magic Specialist](#): You have advantage to dispel and counterspell checks.
- [Scan](#): When using *Sense Magic* or *Weavesight*, you can detect which spells a given creature has available, and how many charges/Mana/etc, as a swift action.

### Rapture
- [Re-Vitae](#): Whenever you spend Vitae, you heal yourself for medium damage per Vitae expended.
-

### Sympathy
- [Sympathetic Magic](#): Whenever you encounter a hostile spell that can distinguish between friend and foe, you can roll a proficient Charisma skill check against the DC to convince the spell you are its friend. The result of this check remains true for the duration of that particular instance of the spell.
- [Spell Stowaway](#): Whenever an enemy within range casts a beneficial spell, you may, as a reaction, manifest a copy of their spell affecting you or an ally.
- [Vital Shield](#): Whenever you are harmed by a spell, you can expend 1 Vitae to reduce the damage by half, or to gain advantage to the saving throw.


### Revelation
- [Foresight](#): once/day, react to anything
- [Prognostication](#): at-will, swift, ranged; you predict the target's next action. When they take it, whatever it is, you may spend a reaction to react to it.
-

### Transference
- [Manifest Phylactery](#): at-will, swift, requires a sympathetic component; you manifest a temporary phylactery of the target, lasting until a short rest. You can convert this to a permanent phylactery if you conduct the normal ritual immediately after combat.
- [Spell Channel](#): if you inflict harm with a spell, natural attack, or a weapon you're currently wielding, you can use that as a channel to puncture that opponent's defenses. This can be used to target them with a spell regardless of line of sight or effect at will. If expended, it can grant advantage to one spell or attack roll against them, as well as increasing damage by 50%.

### Verity
- [Mystic Eyes](#): at will, you can see through glamours, figments, and invisibility spells.


### Entropy
- [Bad Luck](#): Shit happens. It's a well-known axiom of witchcraft. But with careful study and perception, you can learn not to be in front of the fan when it happens. When you roll a d20, and the result is at or below your Entropy rank, you can "store" the result, rolling again. When you have a stored result, you can impose it upon any other PC or NPC whenever they roll a d20, expending it and forcing them to take your result.
- [Death and Decay](#): All things decay. This is something you've accepted. But you don't have to dive into the grave on purpose. You gain Resist 50% (necrotic), and advantage to saves against death magic and ability damage/drain.
- [Death Becomes You](#): The undead are the antithesis of the living, and naturally hate, fear, and long to feed upon them. You understand that, and sympathize with them, and, to an extent, they respect that. Mindless undead become indifferent to you unless actively commanded to attack. Your own undead servants gain inspiration once per encounter.


## Blood Magic
Talent          | Description
--------------|------------
[Talisman of Vitality](#) | Whenever you heal for any reason, you may exceed your max HP, gaining the excess as temporary Hit Points, which expire at the end of the encounter.
[Talisman of Blood](#) | When you are missing Hit Points, you can add your HP debt to the damage of any attack or spell you inflict, to a maximum of 100% of the attack's original damage. This does not change your current HP.

## Familiar
Talent          | Description
--------------|------------
[Familiar](#) | Construct or minor animal becomes a magical servant.

## Necromancy
Talent          | Description
--------------|------------
[Create Undead](#) | Using a corpse and components of non-trivial cost, you can make permanent undead servants.

## Hedgecraft
Tool          | Description
--------------|------------
[Deathball](#) | Craftable vessel allowing you to store an undead minion in stasis until needed.
[Soul Prison](#) | You can create special Soul Gems to house the soul shards of Drain Soul. If a creature dies while you possess their soul shard in such a gem, you trap their soul in the gem.

## Soul
Tool          | Description
--------------|------------
[Reactive Absorb](#) | You can use [Absorb Magic](#) as a reaction against any spell targeting you.
