# Sneak Attack
When you attack with a Dex-based weapon, and your attack has advantage, you inflict bonus damage equal to the weapon's critical bonus damage.

Examples:
- A rank 1 rogue has Dex +2, and is attacking with a light-damage weapon with a critical power of 100%.
  - On a normal hit, they inflict 1d4+1 damage.
  - On a sneak attack or critical hit, they inflict 1d4+1 + 100% damage (or 1d4+1 times 2)
  - On a critical sneak attack, they inflict 1d4+1 + 200%, or 1d4+1 times 3
- A rank 2 rogue with Dex +3 attacks with a medium-damage weapon with a critical power of 100%
  - On a normal hit, they inflict 2d8+3 damage.
  - On a sneak attack or critical hit, they inflict 2d8+3 + 100% damage, or 2d8+3 times 2.
  - On a critical sneak attack, they inflict 2d8+3 + 200% damage, or 2d8+3 times 3.
- A rank 3 rogue with Dex +4 attacks with a medim-damage weapon with a critical power of 150%.
  - On a normal hit, they inflict 3d8+4 damage.
  - On a critical or sneak attack hit, they inflict 3d8+4 + 150%, or 3d8+4 times 2.5
  - On a critical sneak attack hit, they inflict 3d8+4 + 300%, or 3d8+4 times 4
