- A rank 2 rogue with Dex +3 attacks with a medium-damage weapon with a critical power of 100%
  - On a normal hit, they inflict 2d8+3 damage.
  - On a sneak attack or critical hit, they inflict 2d8+3 + 100% damage, or 2d8+3 times 2.

# Powers

## Arcane Trickster
It begins with a simple trick: a magic word, an arcane gesture, maybe a secret symbol. It proves useful to pick pockets, or escape binds, or even to charm innocents out of their gold (or pants). But the Arcane Trickster has stumbled upon (or stolen) arcane secrets, and one is rarely enough to satisfy their curiosity.

- [Legerdemain](#): at-will, swift, concentration; you manifest an invisible hand of force that can perform Dexterity feats at a distance with whatever skill you have. For example, it can pick locks, disarm traps, tie an enemy's shoelaces together, etc. Once you've learned this power, you can take future powers from the [Arcanist](./arcanist.md) list.

## Assassin
With an intricate knowledge the forces of life and death, the assassin is a master of the dark arts, capable of draining the life force from enemies and using it to their advantage. They never forget that the magical forces they wield are as dangerous to them as to their enemies. In such practice, they learn the ways of the [Witch](./witch.md), and the use of Vitae.

- [Soul Blade](../powers/rogue/soul-blade): at-will, 1 minute; you perform a ritual of blood, binding your soul to a weapon. Thereafter, the weapon has the ability to drain Vitae from enemies. You can spend this Vitae to perform Death Attacks, which inflict necrotic damage and can debilitate enemies. Once you've learned this power, you can take future powers from the [Witch](./witch.md) list.

## Bard
You see, there's magic in a song, in the dance that binds people together, in a story that moves people to tears or laughter. You are a bard, and you use your art to inspire others and disorient enemies. It began with a talent, or maybe an insatiable desire for attention. But you discovered something special, something supernatural. Your music moves the soul, and can do so much more.

- [Bardic Music](../powers/rogue/bardic-music.md): at-will, swift; you can make a musical performance that can inspire allies or fascinate onlookers.

## Divine Agent
Some gods favor rogue followers, as they fit their Ethos nicely. Many do not, but still have need of spies, and even assassins, who do their dark work with the secret sanction of the faith. Still other gods find an interesting opportunity when a rogue steals the wrong holy relic, and so binds themself to their service, should they desire absolution. Many such paths exist to guide the rogue to the path of the Divine Agent.

- [Mandate](#): you invoke your divine Ethos, either rendering an enemy vulnerable, or granting boons to an ally. Adopting an Ethos grants you access to the [Priest](./priest.md) power list.

## Hexblade
The outer planes promise infinite power, for a price. Perhaps you made a deal, perhaps you thought you could steal it, perhaps you were just curious. But now you are a Hexblade, bound to planar forces you barely understand, but able to exploit them to exceed any mundane rogue.

- [Hex](#): you place a curse on an enemy, which can grant you a soul shard or other boons, leading to taking [Warlock](./warlock.md) powers.

## Shadowdancer
The power of the void is unlike any earthly magic. Life, death, hellfire, gods...everything is devoured by void in the end. Shadows are awfully useful for those who skulk in the dark, those who wish to pierce through magic, or phase through physical barries. But what fate awaits those who dare to embrace the void?

- [Cloak of Shadows](../powers/rogue/cloak-of-shadows): shadow jump, cloak of shadows, veil, etc. Energy? Powers?


## Spellthief
- [Steal Spell](../powers/rogue/steal-spell): at-will, swift; you can steal a spell or magical power from an enemy, and use it yourself. It is possible to master stolen powers, permanently adding them to your repertoire.


## Soulknife
- [Psiblade](../powers/rogue/psiblade): at-will, swift, concentration; you manifest a psychic blade that can inflict psychic damage and debilitation to enemies. You gain 1 Focus, which can be used to concentrate on your psiblade. Once you've learned this power, you can take future powers from the [Psion](./psion.md) list.
