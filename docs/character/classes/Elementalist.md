## Abilities

### Mark of the Wild
You have the Mark of the Wild, designating you a friend of nature, granting various benefits at all times. You can imbue up to (TBD) allies with this mark.

Rank | Benefits
-----|---------
1    | Naturally-occuring creatures gain +1 attitude toward you
1    | Natural extremes of heat and cold do not bother you
2    | Difficult terrain does not slow you, and you leave no tracks
2    | Natural winds (shy of a hurricane) do not impede you
2    | You can breathe underwater and swim as quickly as you can move on land
3    | You are sustained in the wild, requiring no food and drink
3    | Naturally-occurring creatures gain +2 attitude toward you
3    | You are protected from the effects of prevailing pressure (either positive or negative)

### One With the Elements
When you use Elemental Attunement, you gain additional defenses:

Element | Benefit
--------|--------
Animal  | Resist 50% damage from animal's natural attacks
Fire    | Resist 50% fire damage

etc...  

### Dual Attunement
You can attune to two elements at a time. You need not attune to both with a single use of Elemental Attunement--you could, for example, attune to one element, and wait until some contigency to decide on another element.


### Balance of Nature
When you spend 5 mana on a single element, you can use Elemental Attunement (as a swift action) to swap that element to another one.




### Elemental Boons
Pick an element, get a boon.

#### Air
- [Zephyr](#): Your [Gust of Wind](#) can pull and slide, and do other more dextrous things.
- [Static Charge](#): Your lightning damage spells cause a static cling, inflicting half the original damage as soon as the target moves (within the next 2 rounds).
- [Dissolution](#): You can cast [Mist Form](#) as a reaction to incoming damage.
- [Uplift](#): You can use [Cyclone](#) to levitate yourself (without the usual ill effects)

#### Animals
- [Animal Friends](#): You can use Beast Tongue to make permanent minions out of animals.
- [Wild Shape](#): You can shift into minor animal forms (basic 5e ability).
  - [Improved Wild Shape](#): Shift into more powerful forms.
  - [Wild Magic](#): You can cast Animal spells while in Wild Shape. If you have other shapes from other feats, you can cast the appropriate school in that form.
- [Warg](#): You can establish a rapport with an animal telepathically, and share its senses.

#### Death


#### Earth
- [Earthen Shield](#): You can use the Block reaction to create temporary walls of earth to block medium damage.
- [Magic Stone](#): you can touch stones and turn them into powerful ranged weapons.
- [Tremorsense](#): you gain blindsense within 10 squares, sensing the location of any creatures touching the same ground you touch

#### Fire
- [Flame of Life](#): your flames do not harm natural vegetation or your allies. In fact, they cause the former to grow wildly and the latter to be healed for half the normal damage.

#### Frost
- [Ice Armor](#): You gain a free Frost Barrier at all times (when desired), which recharges with a short rest.
- [Regenerating Ice Wall](#): Holes in your Wall of Ice cause cold damage to those passing through, and re-form ice a round after the opening is made.

#### Plants
- [Shillelagh](#): you can touch a stick and turn it into a powerful weapon (heavy damage, martial trait of your choice).
- [Thorns](#): When Barkskin is active, sharp thorns sprout from you, inflicting medium piercing damage to anyone who strikes you in melee. Entangled enemies are also damaged each time they attempt to escape.
- [Plant Shape](#): You can Wild Shape into plants.

#### Shaman
- [Elemental Form](#): Become an elemental for a short period.
- [Totemic Weapon](#): Imbue weapon with elemental energy, granting bonus damage and effects to weapon strikes.


#### Channeler
- [Eye of the Storm](#): Each round you maintain Control Winds, it increases in radius. You gain a free Gust of Wind within the radius each round. You can levitate while channeling.
- [Maelstrom](#): Each round you maintain Control Water, it increases in radius. Other stuff happens.
- [Wild Growth](#): Each round you maintain Control Plants, it increases in radius. While using it, you can freely Entangle one target each round. The area becomes difficult terrain for enemies.
- [Firestorm](#): Each round you maintain Produce Flame, it increases in intensity. You can use 1 Mana uses freely once per round. Enemies within (insert radius here) suffer light fire damage on turn start.






### Elemental Attunement
At-will, swift; you attune yourself to a single element. Thereafter, you gain a number of powers specific to that element. You may use this power again after a short rest. When used again, you lose the previous attunement.
