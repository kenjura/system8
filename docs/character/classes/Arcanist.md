## Spell Focus

Casting is hard. But it's easier with a focus!

- Wands: targeted spells
- Staves: concentration spells
- Orb: area spells


## Forma

You are able to cast spells by evoking the power of ancient symbols, power words, and arcane formulae. While helpful, these are but aids to master the mental control needed to to envison *formae*, which form the basis of spells.

*Formae* (the plural) each describe a fundamental magical effect, such as opening a portal, or creating light, or transforming an object's shape. To do more complex things, it is possible (through even greater mental effort) to combine multiple *formae* at the same time. A spell comprised of a single *forma* is described as one of the "First Order", whereas one comprised of multiple is "Second Order". "Third Order" does not describe three *formae*, but instead describes a combination of multiple forma, at least one of which is Second-Order. One can imagine Fifth Order spells as quite complex indeed.

+ You do not use an Energy mechanic to cast spells. Rather, you roll skill checks, the DC of which is based on the difficulty of the *formae* and *adjectivae* involved; failure on these checks can cause negative consequences.
+ By default, when casting spells, you use *mnemonics*, which are mental aids in the form of geometric symbols, arcane words, gestures, etc. These are not themselves the components of magic, but rather devices that aid in the construction of *formae* in your mind. It is nearly impossible to learn *formae* without them, although it is possible to cast a well-known spell without them, if necessary. When deprived of your mnemonics, you suffer a penalty to the spellcasting check: -5 if deprived of your voice and -5 if deprived of your ability to gesture.

-----------|--------------|----|------------
Vide (See) | Hidden Light | 20 | Create light invisible to the eye (infrared), which you then see with the aid of divination. Effectively nightvision.

Two uses for each base power:

- Burst (Impleo): what you can do when you charge up a round's worth of mana and let it go all at once. Example: magic missile, flashbang, fireball?

More ideas:
- Enchant into item (imbuo)
- Contingent cast
- Soul bind

## Paths

### Wizard

### Sorcerer

### Golemwright
