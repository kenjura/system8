## Spell Focus

Casting is hard. But it's easier with a focus!

- Wands: targeted spells
- Staves: concentration spells
- Orb: area spells


## Forma

Flavor text.


### Lux (Light)

Let there be light!

Skill Use | DC | Description
----------|----|------------
Fiat Lux  | 10 | Creates an orb of light while you concentrate. Occupies a hand or focus slot.
Light Orb | 14 | Orb of light can fly as you direct, within line of sight.
Flashbang | 17 | Creates a sudden burst of light that blinds creatures (Con ends). Disadvantage if lighting was dim before you cast it.
Searing Light | 20 | Focused light beam causes fire damage.

### Impello (Force)

- Ordo / Ordino (order): mend what is broken; organize what is chaotic
- Parma / Contego (shield): protect yourself
- Porta (portal): you know, portals?
- TBD (passage): opens doors, containers, etc
- Purgo (purify): removes impurities/dirt/etc
- Ignis / Ardeo (fire): burns
- Voce / Loqui (speak): produce a sound your voice is capable of
- Vide (see): see that which you cannot see

### More


#### 2nd-Order Uses

2nd Skill  | Spell        | DC | Description
-----------|--------------|----|------------
Vide (See) | Hidden Light | 20 | Create light invisible to the eye (infrared), which you then see with the aid of divination. Effectively nightvision.
Impelle (Force) | Lux Impello | 17 | Creates an orb of focused light, then hurls it at a foe, causing fire damage.



### Adjectivae

- Inversa (reverse): light to darkness, push to pull, fire to cold, etc
- Persevero: extend a spell's duration beyond concentration
- Roboro: intensify a spell's effect



## Ideas
Two uses for each base power:
- Sustained (Fluere): what you can do continuously (concentration). Example: force shield, lux, flames!
- Burst (Impleo): what you can do when you charge up a round's worth of mana and let it go all at once. Example: magic missile, flashbang, fireball?

More ideas:
- Enchant into item (imbuo)
- Contingent cast
- Soul bind

## Paths

### Wizard

### Sorcerer

### Golemwright

### Chronomancer

They get enchantment points to basically create their own magic items. Like Harry Dresden, obv.
