# Abilities


## Focus
At-will, as a standard action, you can meditate, achieving a state of Focus.

Most Psionic abilities require Focus. Some expend Focus, meaning the state ends. If a power "requires Focus", it remains active while your Focus state is active, and ends as soon as you lose or expend Focus (unless otherwise specified).

If you lose consciousness or enter the Dying state, you lose Focus.

At higher levels, your ability to focus increases beyond normal human capacity. Each time your proficiency bonus or rank increases (level 5, 9, 13, and 17), you gain +1 to your maximum Focus. You are always considered "Focused" if your current Focus is above 0, and "expending Focus" reduces it by 1 instead of automatically ending it.
