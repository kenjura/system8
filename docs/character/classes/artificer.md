# Inventions

## Dragonfire Gauntlet
- Flame Jets: Recharge 33%, std, cone 5; medium fire damage. (Overload: cone 10, heavy fire damage)
- Rocket Punch: Recharge 33%, std; you fly up to 10 squares, then (optionally) deliver a punch for heavy bludgeoning fire damage. (Overload: also cause push 10, and another heavy bludgeoning fire damage burst 2 on impact)
- Fireball: Recharge 33%, std, ranged, burst 3; medium fire damage. (Overload: burst 6, heavy fire damage)

### Upgrades
- Ignition: all fire damage done by the gauntlet also causes half the damage on turn start (Dex ends).
- Wall of Fire (rank 2)


## Shield Projector
- Force Shield: at-will, swift; you activate a shield of force, allowing you to block for medium damage as long as you wield it.
- Shield Wall: at-will, swift; you create a shield wall, extending one square to your left and right, and rising to 10 feet high. All hostile attacks crossing the shield affect the shield first. It has Hit Points equal to a maximum heavy damage roll. Once out of HP, it is no longer useful. It regenerates fully with a short rest.
- Shield Bubble: recharge 33%, swift, ranged; target gains Absorb 100% (limit: heavy damage).

### Overload
As a reaction, you can cause a close burst 3, pushing enemies outside of the radius, then erecting a dome-shaped shield in a 3 square radius, which absorbs all damage to a limit equal to 200% of a heavy damage roll, and blocks all movement and line of effect until taken down.

### Upgrades
- Regenerating Shield: your shield's max HP increase by 100%. It regenerates 25% of its maximum on your turn start, assuming it hasn't been reduced to 0. Otherwise, it must spend an entire turn regenerating to 1 HP, then it can regenerate normally.
- Force Capacitor: all damage you absorb with your force shields can be tallied. Any time you make a physical attack, you can add the tallied amount to your damage as force damage, depleting it. Tallied damage is lost at the end of the encounter if not used.

# Dev Notes

Instead of mana, each Invention will have an Overdrive ability, which has a chance to disable the device until repaired, cause a blowback or malfunction, or, at minimum, render it useless (or in a low power state) until it can recharge.
