# Ethos

Theurgists wield divine magic, sourced from the gods themselves. This magic comes with restrictions: it is meant to be used according to the wishes of said gods.

At level 1, you select 3 Ethoses, representing the most important tenets of your faith. An Ethos is a guideline for how your power should be used. Depending on the specific Ethos, and the subjective judgment of the GM, any given spell your cast can be either Graced, Disgraced, or neutral. This affects the outcome of the spell, as noted in the spell's description.

When casting a spell, you have 1 Grace per Ethos that is graced, -1 per disgrace, and +0 for neutral. Thus, if your spell action is graced by 2 of your Ethos and 1 is neutral, that spell is cast at Grace 2.

Some spells have a minimum Grace. If you have less Grace, you can still attempt to cast the spell, but there is a failure chance, calculated mathematically:
- Minimum grace 2: 50% chance at grace 1, 0% at grace 0
- Minimum grace 3: 66% chance at grace 2, 33% at grace 1.

On failure, there is a penalty.

## Mercy
If a foe 

## Compassion

## Peace
You must attempt to de-escalate violence when possible. If violence is necessary, make every effort to subdue enemies without permanent harm, and preferably without any harm or pain. If escape is possible, without leading to the harm of others, it is preferred to escape. Violence is an absolute last resort, and killing is always Disgraced.


## Fidelity

## Valor

## Beauty

## Sanctity of Life

## Truth

## Distrust



# Domain

Every god and faith has its particulars. A spell list covering every spell a priest could ever need would duplicate every other class' list. Instead, the spell list below consists only of the spells available to all Theurgists, and only to them.

For the rest, there are Domains. Effectively, a Domain is any spell school from any other class, for which your god or faith is uniquely suited. For example, if you worship the God of Fire, you can take the Fire school from Elementalism as your Domain. A worshipper of a faith that exalts the creation of undead can take the Undeath school from Thauamturgy as their Domain.

You automatically know all Domain spells of a rank you can cast.

At level 5, you gain a 2nd Domain.

# Spell Descriptions

## Halo
Pally aura?

## Holy Light
At-will, standard, ranged; a ray of divine light shines down on the target. Allies are healed for medium/heavy/double heavy damage; enemies suffer medium/double heavy radiant damage.

Talents:
- Holy Fire: effect also causes 50% of the original healing/damage ongoing for 3 rds.
- Daybreak: you can change the area to a cone 3/4/5, healing/harming for light/medium/heavy.
- Blinding Light: enemies also suffer blinded (Con ends).

## Salvation
At-will, reaction, ranged, requires 3+ grace; you save an ally from harm. If they're about to take damage, it is nullified by a divine shield. If they're about to get crushed or fall off a cliff, they are moved to safety. If they fail a save against a death spell, they pass it instead.

## Shield of Power
At-will, swift, ranged; subject gains Absorb 100%, limit based on grace:
- 1: medium damage
- 2: heavy damage
- 3: double heavy damage

Talents:
- Regenerating Shield: each round, on subject's turn start, if their shield hasn't been completely destroyed, it regains half its maximum strength.
- Reflective Shield: when the shield absorbs damage, it causes retributive radiant damage to the attacker equal to the amount absorbed.
- Spell Shield (requires rank 2): the shield can absorb non-damaging effects, such as debilitations, of a rank equal to or less than your rank. When targeted by such a spell, if a medium damage roll by the effect's caster does not exceed the current limit, reduce it by that amount, and the spell is nullified (or reflected, if you have Reflective Shield).
- Barrier: (requires rank 3) you create a circle 2/4/6, and all allies inside are protected by the absorption. The absorption limit is increased by 50% per ally in the effect when it is cast.
  
## Ward
At-will, swift, concentration, emanation 5/10, requires 2+ Grace; you protect yourself and allies from a chosen type of harm. Choose one:
- Gain resist 50% to one energy type
- Gain advantage to saves against necrotic effects and resist 50% to necrotic damage
- Gain advantage to saves against hostile transmutations
- Gain advantage to saves against mental effects
