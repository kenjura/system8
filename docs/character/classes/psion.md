# Abilities


## Focus
Focus is an extension of the basic [concentration](./basics.md#concentration) mechanic. Through meditation and self-reflection, you have expanded ability to concentrate your mind beyond normal limits.

At rank 1, you gain 1 Focus, and 1 more each rank thereafter.

Think of Focus as extra concentration slots. With 1 Focus, you can concentrate on two powers at a time.

Many psionic powers require concentration. Some require multiple slots of concentration, and will be listed as "concentration (2 slots)" or similar.

Some psionic powers have powerful modes of operation that require expending Focus. A power that expends n points of Focus reduces your Focus by that amount. So, if you have 2 Focus, you can expend two 1-Focus powers, or one 2-Focus power. In fact, you can overextend, expending your baseline concentration stat itself, leaving you unable to concentrate on anything.

If a power expends Focus *and* requires concentration, you must have enough unexpended Focus or baseline concentration to maintain the power after expending.

Some psionic powers require you to be in a "Focused" state. This means you have at least one unexpended Focus (not your baseline concentration).

There are rank 0 powers in every school that help you gain Focus. You can also use the Meditate action to enter a Focused state:
* ''Meditate'': At-will, std; you meditate, gaining 1 Focus, or restoring your baseline concentration if expended.
