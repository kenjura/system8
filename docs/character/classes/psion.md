- 1 Talent per level?



## Abilities


### Focus
At-will, as a standard action, you can meditate, achieving a state of Focus.

Most Psionic abilities require Focus. Some expend Focus, meaning the state ends. If a power "requires Focus", it remains active while your Focus state is active, and ends as soon as you lose or expend Focus (unless otherwise specified).

If you lose consciousness or enter the Dying state, you lose Focus.


### Mind Over Body
While you are in a state of Focus, your physical abilities are augmented by your mental ones.
- Your Strength is increased by your Charisma bonus.
- Your Dexterity is increased by your Intelligence bonus.
- Your Constitution is increased by your Wisdom bonus.

All of these bonuses are capped by your current Psion level.
