# Bags

## Handy Handbag
Level 3, 2 gp

This handbag holds a lot more than it would seem. It has an interior space much larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 cubic feet in volume. The bag can hold up to 100 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 8 cubic feet. The bag weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires a swift action.

## Bottomless Backpack
Level 7, 11 gp

This well-worn leather backpack appears ordinary from the outside, but its interior opens into an extradimensional space far larger than any mundane pack. It can hold up to 500 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The backpack weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the backpack requires a swift action. If the backpack is destroyed, its contents are scattered across the Astral Plane.

## Portable Vault
Level 11, 34 gp

This leather satchel contains a folded piece of supple hide that, when laid flat on a solid surface and activated with a command word, unfolds into a 5-foot-diameter circular portal. The portal leads to a secure extradimensional vault—a stone chamber roughly 10 feet by 10 feet by 10 feet. The vault can hold up to 10,000 pounds of material. Items placed within are preserved perfectly, immune to decay or environmental damage. The portal can only be opened by the attuned owner or those they designate. Folding the hide closes the portal; the vault and its contents persist safely until reopened.

## Wondrous Warehouse
Level 15, 105 gp

This ornate leather scroll case contains a magical deed to an extradimensional warehouse. When the deed is read aloud, a shimmering portal appears leading to a massive storage facility—a 100-foot by 100-foot chamber with 30-foot ceilings, lined with shelves and organized storage areas. The warehouse is staffed by spectral automatons that can store, organize, retrieve, and even catalog items at your verbal command. Retrieving a specific item takes only a swift action as an automaton delivers it through the portal. The warehouse can hold virtually unlimited mundane goods, though magical items are limited to 100. The automatons cannot leave the warehouse or perform tasks other than storage and retrieval.

# Boots

## Comfy Shoes
Level 2, 1 gp

These fashionable shoes come in a variety of styles—loafers, ballet flats, ankle boots—but all share the same magical properties. The interior is always perfectly dry and temperature-regulated, with arch support that adjusts to your foot. They never cause blisters, no matter how far you walk. When hustling overland (traveling at an accelerated pace), you gain resistance to the nonlethal damage normally suffered from the exertion.

## Spider Slippers
Level 5, 5.5 gp

These soft-soled slippers are woven from treated phase spider silk and lined with the fine hairs of giant spiders. While wearing them, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. The slippers lose their adhesive property if you are carrying more than your normal carrying capacity.

## Root Boots
Level 5, 5.5 gp

These sturdy boots are crafted from treant bark-leather and lined with moss that never dries out. While wearing them, you ignore difficult terrain caused by natural environmental features such as undergrowth, loose stones, mud, ice, or snow. You also cannot slip on any natural surface, no matter how slick. Additionally, you leave no tracks or other traces of your passage through natural terrain, making you impossible to track by nonmagical means.

## Sneakers of Springing
Level 5, 5.5 gp

These sleek, lightweight shoes are crafted from displacer beast hide with soles of compressed air elemental essence. They muffle your footfalls to near-silence, granting advantage on Stealth checks where moving quietly is important. Your jump distance (both long jump and high jump) is doubled. Once per encounter, as a free action, you can activate a burst of speed that doubles your base movement for one round (recharge 33%).

## Dread Treads
Level 7, 11 gp

These heavy boots or armored greaves are crafted from basilisk hide with soles of magnetized lodite. When you plant your feet, you become immovable by mundane means. You are immune to any effect that would push, pull, or slide you against your will. You also have advantage on checks and saves to resist being grappled, tripped, or knocked prone. As a swift action, you can release the anchoring effect to move normally.

## Pump-you-Ups
Level 7, 11 gp

These whimsical pumps feature a small air bladder in each heel that, when activated, fills with lighter-than-air alchemical gas. While wearing them, you can levitate up to 30 feet off the ground as a swift action. You can move horizontally at half your walking speed while levitating, but cannot ascend higher than 30 feet. The levitation lasts until you dismiss it or touch the ground. You can adjust your altitude by up to 10 feet as part of your movement each turn.

## Turbo Heelies
Level 7, 11 gp

These boots feature small wheels that retract into reinforced heels when not in use. When deployed (swift action), the wheels are propelled by bound air elementals, granting you a Drive speed of 50 feet per round on any reasonably flat surface. While driving, you must move at least 20 feet in a straight line before you can turn. You can retract the wheels as a free action, but stopping suddenly from full speed requires an Acrobatics check (DC 12) or you fall prone.

## Winged Wingtips
Level 10, 26 gp

These elegant leather shoes or sandals feature stylized wings at the ankles that become real, feathered wings when activated. As a swift action, you gain a fly speed of 30 feet. You must land at the end of your turn unless you have a feature that allows hovering. The wings can support you and your normal equipment, but not additional passengers or excessive cargo. The wings can be dismissed as a free action, folding back into decorative leather.

# Cloaks

## Cloak of the Landshark
Level 6, 8 gp

This heavy cloak is fashioned from the hide of a bulette, complete with the creature's distinctive dorsal ridge running down the back. When you pull the hood up and crouch (swift action), you can burrow through loose earth, sand, or gravel at a speed of 20 feet. While burrowing, you gain tremorsense out to 30 feet, allowing you to detect creatures and objects in contact with the ground. You cannot burrow through solid rock, and the tunnel you create collapses behind you. You can breathe normally while underground.

## Werefur Mantle
Level 3+, varies

This luxurious fur mantle is crafted from the pelt of a lycanthrope, preserving a portion of the creature's shapeshifting essence. As a standard action, you can transform into the animal form associated with the mantle (wolf, bear, rat, boar, etc.). You retain your mental ability scores but gain the physical statistics, senses, and natural attacks of the animal. You cannot cast spells or speak while transformed, but can maintain concentration on ongoing effects. The transformation lasts up to 1 hour or until dismissed as a swift action. You can use this ability once per short rest.

| Variant | Level | Cost |
|---------|-------|------|
| Wererat Mantle | 3 | 2 gp |
| Werewolf Mantle | 5 | 5.5 gp |
| Wereboar Mantle | 7 | 11 gp |
| Werebear Mantle | 9 | 19 gp |
| Weretiger Mantle | 11 | 34 gp |

# Gloves

## Good Gloves
Level 3, 2 gp

These sturdy workman's gloves are crafted from supple leather with reinforced fingertips. Each knuckle features a small brass button. When you press a button while holding a handheld tool or weapon (up to 5 pounds), the item vanishes into an extradimensional space linked to that button. Pressing the same button again retrieves the stored item instantly into your hand (free action). Each glove can store up to 4 items (8 total), and the buttons glow faintly when an item is stored within.

## Far Fists
Level 3, 2 gp

These fingerless martial arts gloves are crafted from lightweight leather and wrapped with enchanted cloth strips. When you make an unarmed strike, you can project the force of the blow as a ranged attack against any target within 30 feet. The attack uses your normal unarmed strike statistics and deals force damage instead of bludgeoning. The projected strike is visible as a brief shimmer in the air along the path of the attack.

## Trickster's Glove
Level 3, 2 gp

This single slender glove is crafted from the finest silk, nearly invisible when worn. It projects telekinetic "fingers" that can manipulate objects at a distance of up to 30 feet. You can use Sleight of Hand to pick pockets, plant objects, or perform fine manipulation at range. You can also attempt Security checks (picking locks, disabling traps) at the same range. The telekinetic fingers are invisible, and observers must succeed on a Perception check opposed by your Sleight of Hand to notice anything amiss.

## Phantom Hand
Level 5, 5.5 gp

This unusual "glove" consists of silver rings for each finger, ornate fingertip covers, and delicate chains connecting them across the back of the hand. When you cast a spell with a range of touch, you can deliver it at a range of 30 feet instead. A spectral hand manifests and carries the spell to the target. For hostile touch spells, you still make a melee spell attack, but at range. The phantom hand cannot be targeted or damaged.

## Defender's Gauntlet
Level 5, 5.5 gp

This heavy leather gauntlet features reinforced knuckles and a magnetic clasp on the back of the hand. You can attach a one-handed melee weapon to the gauntlet, which then animates and hovers near you, acting semi-independently. Once per round, the hovering weapon can either make an attack of opportunity against a creature that provokes one, or attempt a parry (using your reaction to add your proficiency bonus to AC against one attack you can see). The weapon uses your attack and damage modifiers.

## Master Hand
Level 7, 11 gp

This elegant white formal glove is embroidered with silver thread in geometric patterns. When activated (swift action), it projects a Large spectral hand made of shimmering force. The hand hovers within 30 feet and can be directed with your bonus action to perform one of the following: shove a creature (using your spellcasting or Strength modifier), make an unarmed strike dealing 2d8 force damage, provide cover to an ally (half cover), or manipulate objects weighing up to 500 pounds. The hand persists for 1 minute or until dismissed. Recharge after a short rest.

## Ghost Glove
Level 8, 14 gp

This pale glove is woven from phase spider silk harvested under a new moon. While wearing it, you can phase your hand and forearm through solid objects up to 2 feet thick as a swift action. You can reach through walls to unlock doors from the inside, retrieve objects from locked containers, or deliver touch attacks through barriers. You cannot move your entire body through objects with this glove, only your arm. Living creatures and magical barriers are solid to the phased hand.
