## Shaping
- Bottle of Thin Air: this empty bottle, when unstoppered, sucks in all available air in a 15 foot radius in an instant (technically about 8.7 ms at sea level). Thereafter, the bottle's magic keeps environmental air from collapsing into the void, maintaining the vacuum in the area. The bottle's magic is finite, so the radius decreases by 1 square every 2 rounds (3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0). If allowed to drain fully, it releases the stored air into the environment, which shatters the bottle and causes a loud clap that might pop your ears. If stoppered before fully draining, the bottle contains the air that was sucked in, and the vacuum maintenance fades quickly, causing a burst of wind that is painful, but probably not as painful as the vacuum was. A stoppered vial will release its stored air when shattered or unstoppered.
