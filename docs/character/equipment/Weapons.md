# Weapons
Normal (non-magical) weapons are described herein.

# Simple Melee Weapons

All characters have proficiency with simple weapons. Simple weapons inflict one of three damage types (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing), and their basic mechanics are given by their weight using the table below.

| Weapon Type | Damage | Ability Score | Handedness          |
|-------------|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| Light       | 1d4    | Dex           | One-hand or offhand |
| Medium      | 1d8    | Dex or Str    | One-hand            |
| Heavy       | 1d12   | Str           | Two-hand            |


# Simple Ranged Weapons
All characters have proficiency with simple ranged weapons.

| Weapon Type | Damage | Ability Score | Handedness          | Range   |
|-------------|--------|---------------|---------------------|---------|
| Light       | 1d4    | Dex           | One-hand or offhand | 30/120  |
| Medium      | 1d6    | Dex or Str    | Two-hand            | 60/240  |
| Heavy       | 1d8    | Str           | Two-hand            | 100/400 |

# Martial weapons
Martial weapons are made for war, designed for use by trained fighters. Only some classes have proficiency with these weapons.

Any given martial weapon uses the mechanics of a Simple Weapon (see above), with one additional modifier from the list below. The additional properties of the modifier require Proficiency. Some abilities require Expertise or even Mastery.



## Cleaving
- Proficient: On a successful hit, you can immediately roll another attack on an adjacent enemy within reach.
- Expertise: You can keep chaining cleaves until you run out of adjacent enemies within reach.
- Mastery: Instead of rolling normally, you can, as a standard action, make a single attack which affects all enemies within reach.

## Reach
- Proficiency: Gain +1 reach with all attacks with the weapon, and also threaten the extra area.
- Expertise: When your attack of opportunity with the weapon succeeds, you arrest any movement the enemy was making.
- Mastery: Instead of a normal attack, you can attack any number of creatures in a line extending from you to the extent of reach.

## Defensive
- Proficient: The weapon can be used to Block (its normal damage). Parry attempts with the weapon gain a bonus equal to your proficiency bonus.
- Expertise: Once per round per proficiency bonus, parry or block attempts with the weapon do not require spending a reaction.
- Mastery: When Block attempts fail, you still block half the normal damage.

## Piercing
- Proficiency: When successfully striking an enemy with a non-zero armor bonus, you reduce their armor bonus by your proficiency bonus for 1 round (non-stacking).
- Expertise: Armor piercing penalty lasts 3 rds.
- Mastery: Your attacks ignore your proficiency bonus' worth of armor bonus.

## Crushing
- Proficiency: On successful strike, you cause staggered. Staggered opponents have disadvantage on their next parry, dodge, or block attempt, or 50% reduction to their next move action, whichever comes first.
- Expertise: On successful strike, instead of staggering, you can cause a knockdown (Str negates) or push back 1 square (no save, must be your size or smaller).
- Mastery: On critical hits, or any hit where none of your damage was absorbed or resisted, the enemy is stunned for 1 rd (Con negates).

## Prehensile (i.e. whip)
- Proficiency: The weapon can be used to trip or disarm, and neither invites a counter-trip or counter-disarm.
- Expertise: The weapon can be used to grapple.
- Mastery: ?

## Stealthy
- Proficiency: When striking with advantage, gain proficiency bonus as bonus critical range.
- Expertise: When striking with advantage, always add critical bonus damage; on crit, add it again.
- Mastery: When striking with advantage, all critical bonus damage is also ongoing (Con ends).



## Ranged Only

## Fully Automatic
  - Proficiency: On successful hit, can attempt another attack on the same target at -10. Stackable.
  - Expertise: Instead of targeting one creature, you can shoot everyone in a cone, inflicting normal damage with a Dex save to negate.
  - Mastery: Area attack is save half; autofire is -5 penalty.
## Repeater (semi-automatic)
  - Proficiency: you can fire three times (if ammunition allows), gaining advantage to the attack roll.
  - Expertise: You can fire three times, targeting three different enemies in a cone.
  - Mastery: on hit, you can fire again at the same target. If that hits, you can try it again (max 3 shots).



# Exotic Weapons
Exotic weapons have more than one Martial property. Warrior classes do not get proficiency in exotic weapons for free as they do with Martial weapons, but you can still learn proficiency with a feat.






# Weapon Enhancements

Through magic, special materials, class abilities, or other means, it is possible to enhance a weapon beyond its physical properties.

## Keen
A keen weapon strikes true, seeking the most vulnerable location to inflict maximum damage.

- All ranks: gain +1 per rank to critical range and +50% to critical damage multiplier.
- Rank 1: each non-critical hit adds 5 points of critical vulnerability to the target, meaning all attacks against them have 5 points of effective critical range. This lasts until the next critical hit lands on the target.
- Rank 2: after a successful critical hit on any subject, gain +5 critical threat range to your next attack with the weapon.
- Rank 3: critical vulnerability added to target is now 10 points instead of 5.
- Rank 4: when you score a critical hit, roll again (without any crit vulnerability bonuses). If that attack is also a critical hit, apply the critical damage multiplier again. (Ex: base damage 10, crit mult 3, crit damage is normally 30, but in this case, 90).
- Rank 5: tbd

## Flaming
A flaming weapon engulfs in flame when drawn, burning enemies with every strike.

- All ranks: add "fire" to damage type in addition to normal type. Each attack inflicts 50% of its damage as ongoing damage (Dex ends).
- Rank 1: at-will, std, cone 3; sweeping the weapon in a wide arc, you generate a fan of flame, inflicting half the weapon's damage (plus same as ongoing fire damage, Dex ends) as fire damage to all subjects within.
- Rank 2: when you inflict damage with this weapon against a target already suffering ongoing fire damage, it causes a burst of fire, inflicting half base damage as fire damage to all enemies in a burst 2.
- Rank 3: tbd

## Radiant
This weapon is made of brilliant energy, not mere metal, wood, etc. It can penetrate many normal defenses.

- All ranks: ignore 4 points of armor bonus per rank. Damage type switches to radiant. Weapon sheds light like a torch.
- Rank 1: tbd

## Powerful
A powerful weapon focuses on damage above all, magnifying the momentum of every strike delivered.

- All ranks: gain +1 damage per rank, per damage die. (Example: rank 2 enhanced weapon that deals 3d12 would gain +6 bonus damage from this enhancement)
- Rank 1: when you inflict damage with this weapon, you cause a burst 1, inflicting this enhancement's bonus damage as force damage to enemies in the area. Area increases to burst 2 at rank 3, and to burst 3 at rank 5.
- Rank 2: when inflicting damage with this weapon, roll damage twice, and use the higher result.
- Rank 3: each time you inflict damage with this weapon, gain +1 damage die with all further attacks this encounter, max 1 die per rank.
- Rank 4/5: tbd

## Warding
A warding weapon is a stalwart defender, always ready to shield you from all harm.

- All ranks: gain +1 to AC and +2 to Parry per rank.
- Rank 1: the weapon can be used to parry missiles and targeted spells.
- Rank 2: the weapon can be used by your allies to parry, using your Parry roll, but the ally's reaction. Ally must be within 3 squares.
- Rank 3: tbd
