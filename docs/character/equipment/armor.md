# Armor

# Base Armor
Armor Type | Armor Class     | Base Cost | Other
-----------|-----------------|-----------|------
None       | 10 + Dex        | 0         |
Light      | 10 + prof + Dex | tbd       |
Heavy      | 10 + prof + Str | tbd       | Fortification, Stealth disadvantage

- "Prof" is your proficiency bonus, if proficient in that armor type
- Fortification means that a confirmation roll is required to inflict critical hits against you. Example:
  - You are proficient with heavy armor and have an AC of 10 + prof (+3) + Str (+3), or 16.
  - Enemy attacks you, rolling a natural 20, hitting automatically with a critical hit.
  - Since you have Fortification, the enemy must roll another attack. 
    - If that attack misses your AC, the original hit still succeeds, but is *not* a critical hit.
    - If the confirmation attack hits your AC, the critical hit succeeds, inflicting critical damage.

# Exceptional Materials
Normal armor is made of materials ideal for ordinary use cases, costing a reasonable amount. For example:
- Light armor typically uses dense cloth, leather, hide, fur, and/or bone.
- Heavy armor typically uses iron and steel, bonded to a heavy base of dense cloth and/or leather.

There are other materials that can be used, which have their own advantages and disadvantages.
