# Bad Luck

Shit happens. It's a well-known axiom of witchcraft. But with careful study and perception, you can learn not to be in front of the fan when it happens. When you roll a d20, and the result is at or below your Entropy rank, you can "store" the result, rolling again. When you have a stored result, you can impose it upon any other PC or NPC whenever they roll a d20, expending it and forcing them to take your result.
