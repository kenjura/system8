# Frozen Blood

When you drop to 0 HP, you have the option to immediately begin concentrating on an effect which prevents you from dying. While active, you do not need to roll death saves, and you can act normally. Any damage you suffer should be tracked, because if you stop concentrating while you are in negative HP, you will begin to die as normal. If you heal above 0 HP, the effect ends.
