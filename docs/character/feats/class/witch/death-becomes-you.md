# Death Becomes You

The undead are the antithesis of the living, and naturally hate, fear, and long to feed upon them. You understand that, and sympathize with them, and, to an extent, they respect that. Mindless undead become indifferent to you unless actively commanded to attack. Your own undead servants gain inspiration once per encounter.
