# Spell Channel

If you inflict harm with a spell, natural attack, or a weapon you're currently wielding, you can use that as a channel to puncture that opponent's defenses. This can be used to target them with a spell regardless of line of sight or effect at will. If expended, it can grant advantage to one spell or attack roll against them, as well as increasing damage by 50%.
