# Soul Gem

You can prepare a soul gem (at a cost of TBD gold per HD of capacity). If you slay a creature, you can trap their soul in the gem, preventing any form of resurrection, and allowing uses of their trapped soul.
- Soul Sacrifice: upon suffering death, you can sacrifice the trapped soul, expending it, and negating the death effect.
- Death Eater: as a swift action, you can absorb a trapped soul, healing yourself equal to the soul's original max HP, expending it.
- Shadow Identity: at-will, swift, concentration; you take on the appearance of the soul's owner, as they appeared in life.
