*Class Feat*

# Countersong

**Recharge 33%, Reaction to any hostile effect that relies on sound**

You attempt to counter the effect. Roll Perform; if your result meets or exceeds the hostile effect, you negate it.

If the effect is ongoing, you must continually perform to continue to negate it, which requires Concentration; as soon as your Countersong ends, it stops negating the effect (if it was still going).
