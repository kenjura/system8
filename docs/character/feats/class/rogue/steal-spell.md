*Rogue Maneuver (Spellthief)*

# Steal Spell

**At-will, Standard Action, Melee range, Requires advantage**

You attempt to steal a spell or magical power from the subject. Subject must either be a creature with the ability to cast spells, or a magic item that produces spell-like effects. Roll a Sleight of Hand check; the subject may resist with Perception check.

- **On success:** you steal a random spell that the subject possesses. (see below)
- **On failure:** nothing happens.

When you steal a spell, you gain a single, consumable use of that spell, exactly as described. You may use it any time before the next long rest; if not used by then, it fades away. The subject "loses" the spell, which varies in meaning:
- If they have spell slots or Mana, they lose an amount equal to what they would spend casting that spell normally.
- If the ability has a cooldown, it goes on cooldown as if it was used by the subject.

Normally, the spell you steal is determined randomly (equal chance for each known spell). However, if you have knowledge of what spells the subject has, you can target a specific spell with your attempt.

If your spell theft decreased spell slots or Mana in the subject, you have the option of gaining said slots or Mana yourself instead of casting the spell.
