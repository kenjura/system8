# Power of Suggestion

**Requires [Fascinating Performance](./fascinating-performance)**

While Fascinating Performance is active, you can spend a standard action to make a suggestion to the fascinated subjects. It must be reasonable harmless, such as "follow me", or "everybody clap". Anything that a normal, not-fascinated person who was otherwise interested in your performance would consider dangerous or repugnant automatically fails (e.g. "give me all your money" or "punch yourself in the face"). Subjects follow reasonable suggestions until they pass a Wis save to end; on success, they are still fascinated. You can't have two suggestions active at once; making a new one ends the previous one.
