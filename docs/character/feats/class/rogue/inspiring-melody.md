# Inspiring Melody

**Encounter, Swift, Close Burst 10**

Allies hear your song and are inspired to greatness. Each ally gains one token, which can be applied as they please to any single d20 roll during the encounter.

Applying the token improves the roll by 1d6 (increasing to 1d8 at rank 2, 1d10 at rank 3, etc).

This not only increases the result, but can also create critical success (for example, rolling a 16 naturally, then rolling 4 or higher on the inspiration, would count as a natural 20).
