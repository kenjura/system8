*Rogue Maneuver (Shadowdancer)*

# Shadow Play

**Recharge 33%, Swift, Concentration**

While in dimness or darkness, you can create shadowy silhouettes of creatures and objects within a circle 2. They are insubstantial, but they may fool onlookers, who assume they are real unless they physically interact with them, in which case they are allowed a Wisdom save to disbelieve the illusion. PCs are allowed to declare that they disbelieve at any time, but they must still succeed at the saving throw.
