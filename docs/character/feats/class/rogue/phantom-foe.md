# Phantom Foe

**Recharge 33%, Swift, Concentration, 1 Vitae**

Subject is haunted by a phantasmal attacker. They cannot see them (nobody can, it's an illusion), but they remain alert to the foe's attacks. As such, you and allies gain the Flanking bonus against subject, even if only one is threatening the subject.
