# Fascinating Song

**Encounter, Standard, Emanation 10, Concentration**

At-will, swift, concentration, emanation 10, short rest; you captivate your audience with a performance. Roll a Perform check; subjects in the area are fascinated (unable to take actions other than to watch and listen to you) while you concentrate and continue to perform (Wis ends). Subjects who are aware of a possible threat cannot be affected. Affected subjects are instantly freed of the effect if they take damage or suffer a debilitation.
