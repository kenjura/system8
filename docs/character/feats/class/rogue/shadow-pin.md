# Shadow Pin

**Recharge 33%, Swift, Ranged**

You pin subject's shadow in place, thereby preventing subject from moving from their current position. They can attempt to free themselves with a Strength save once/rd, but on success, they must also suffer medium slashing damage to escape. Only works if subject casts a shadow.
