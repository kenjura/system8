# Fascinating Song

**Encounter, Standard, Emanation 10, Concentration**

Subjects who are not in combat are fascinated, fully paying attention to your song.

You must spend a standard action each round performing in order to maintain this effect (in addition to normal concentration rules).

Those subjects who have reason to attempt not to pay attention to you, such as perceiving hostile action, suspecting your motives, or, if a PC, no reason necessary, are allowed a Wisdom save against your Perform check once per round to end the effect. In general, NPCs must have a valid reason to attempt this.

Any obvious hostile action, such as an attack on subject or an ally that they are able to perceive while paying attention to you, automatically ends the effect.
