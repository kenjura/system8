# Runeforge

You can imbue your weapon or weapons with up to 3 runes (3 on a two-hander, or 1-2 on each one-handed weapon or shield). The runes available are:
- Rune of Blood: can be expended to cause a melee attack to heal you for the damage done.
- Rune of Frost: can be expended to add 50% frost damage to an attack, which also gains bonus critical chance equal to the movement reduction the subject is suffering (e.g. 50% from chilled and 100% from rooted).
- Rune of Death: can be expended to add 50% necrotic damage plus each disease on subject causes one round's worth of damage instantly.
