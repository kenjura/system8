# Death's Advance

Your movement speed cannot be reduced below 50% by any means, and you resist half of any forced movement effect (such as push, pull, and slide). Once per encounter, as a swift action, you can remove any and all movement-impairing effects from yourself, and remain immune to them until the beginning of your next turn.
