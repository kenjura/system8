# Precise Shot

You can use your Aim "token" for other purposes besides advantage to attack rolls, such as:

- **Deadly Shot:** instead of advantage to attack, gain advantage to damage roll
- **Wing Clip:** your attack causes 50% movement reduction (Con ends)
- **Concussive Shot:** your attack causes *dazed* (lose move and swift actions) (Con ends)
- **Hand Shot:** your attack causes disadvantage to attacks made with a certain hand (Con ends)
