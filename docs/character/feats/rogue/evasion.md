# Evasion

You can use the Dodge reaction against area effects. Instead of the attack's DC (if it had one), you must roll against DC 10 + 5 per square, where the number of squares is the number you must move to escape the effect (maximum: your normal movement rate). If you succeed, you leap to the nearest safe square and avoid the effect. Otherwise, you do not move, and suffer the effect normally.
