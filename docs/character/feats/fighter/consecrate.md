# Consecrate

Recharge 33%, swift, centered circle 2; you create a zone of hallowed ground. Infernal or undead creatures within the area are compelled to leave; to stay, they must pass a Charisma save, which allows them to remain for one round (at which point they must save again), and they suffer medium radiant damage for remaining in the area. If they fail the save, or forego it, they must spend all available actions to vacate the area, until such time as they are no longer inside it, at which point they may act normally. Any such enemy who attempts to enter the area, including making melee attacks against creatures inside while standing outside, must pass the same save to take such action, and suffer the same penalty for doing so; failing the save causes the action to fail and be lost. If an enemy cannot possibly exit the area, they are not forced to leave; instead, they are offered a Charisma save to negate the radiant damage each round.

At rank 3, all attacks by infernal/undead creatures within the area, as well as attacks made by such creatures outside it against those inside it, suffer disadvantage.
