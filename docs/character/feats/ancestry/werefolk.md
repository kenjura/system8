*Ancestry Feat*

# Werefolk

You have an animal form and a human form.

Your animal form choice gives you certain abilities all the time, and (generally) more powerful abilities when shifted.

**Call of the Wild:** You suffer an ability called Call of the Wild, which can compel you to transform and act in an animal manner in certain circumstances (e.g. predators are aroused to hunt by the scent of blood or fear). The full moon triggers your Call powerfully.

**Example subtypes:** wolf, tiger, bear, etc.
