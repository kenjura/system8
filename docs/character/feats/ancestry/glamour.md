# Glamour

At-will, you can assume an enchantment that enhances your appearance in both visual and magical ways, rendering you unusually attractive and captivating.

You gain advantage to any Charisma check for which this would apply (e.g. it is useful for most Persuasion checks, but not so much for Intimidate).
