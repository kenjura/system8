# Underwater Native

You have a swim speed of 6, and you can breathe underwater.

You can also breathe above water (because otherwise this ability would be terrible). However, you cannot stay out of the water indefinitely.

**Requirement:** You need at least 8 hours of "water time" per day. Outside of natural bodies of water, a bath or pool is ideal, but there are also conceivable magical or technological items to recirculate water over you, or even to provide a water-tight suit (sort of a reverse scuba gear) that keeps you hydrated 24/7.
