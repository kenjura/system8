# Psychic Symbiote

Your mind is host to an alien being, one made of pure thought and energy. You can have conversations with it; it shares your perceptions, but does not control your actions; it has alien knowledge that may be of use to you, but could also be horrifying or maddening to comprehend.

**Daily:** It can negate a failed mental save, taking the effect instead of you.

**Short Rest:** It can hold concentration on a mental action (such as maintaining a spell) in your stead, allowing you to use your concentration for something else.
