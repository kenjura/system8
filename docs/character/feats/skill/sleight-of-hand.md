# Sleight of Hand

You can draw or stow a weapon or item as a free action.

You can pick pockets, plant items, or perform legerdemain without being noticed if your target is distracted or unaware of you.

You can disable simple traps and locks without tools, and you gain advantage when using thieves' tools.
