*Skill Feat*

# Intimidating

You can demoralize an enemy as a swift action (at-will; target within 6 squares who can see or hear you becomes frightened of you until the end of your next turn; Will negates).

Creatures you have demoralized take a penalty equal to your proficiency bonus on their next attack roll against you.
