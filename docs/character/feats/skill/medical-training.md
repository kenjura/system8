*Skill Feat*

# Medical Training

You can stabilize a dying creature as a swift action instead of a standard action.

You can diagnose diseases and poisons, and you know their typical treatments.

When you use a healing kit or administer a potion, the target regains additional HP equal to your Wisdom bonus.
