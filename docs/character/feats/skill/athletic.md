*Skill Feat*

# Athletic

Your Dash distance increases by your Strength bonus. You gain a Jump, Swim, and Climb speed equal to your Strength bonus in squares.

You gain a Sprint action (at-will, std; move up to four times your base movement speed in a straight line; you can end this movement early; you cannot make attacks or use powers during this movement; you stop if you hit an obstacle).
