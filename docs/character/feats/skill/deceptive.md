# Deceptive

You can lie convincingly under pressure, even when your story has obvious holes.

You can maintain a false identity indefinitely, and you gain advantage on checks to disguise yourself or forge documents.

You can feint in combat as a swift action, causing your next attack against that target to have advantage.
