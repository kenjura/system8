*Skill Feat*

# Persuasive

You can negotiate favorable terms in deals and disputes.

You can request aid, information, or shelter from friendly or neutral NPCs with greater success.

Once per day, you can turn a hostile NPC indifferent (or an indifferent NPC friendly) if you can speak with them for at least one minute.
