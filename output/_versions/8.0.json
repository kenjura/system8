Then, follow up with a real attack.\n- [Skill Expertise](): Choose any nonmagical skill; you can roll this skill with advantage.\n- [Sneak Attack](): when attacking an opponent, if you have advantage, your attack inflicts bonus medium damage.\n- [Evasion](): reaction to any damaging or debilitating attack; roll Acrobatics, DC 10 + 5 per square of distance needed to be clear of the attack. On success, you leap to the nearest safe square, avoiding the attack.\n- [Sap](): when attacking an opponent with a bludgeoning weapon, if you have advantage, you can stun them instead of inflicting damage (Fort ends).\n- [Kick](): reaction, melee range, triggered by an enemy casting a spell or using similar focus-demanding action; you make an unarmed attack. If you hit and inflict damage, subject must pass a Concentration check to keep their action.\n- [Silver Tongue](): requires proficiency in Persuasion. As a one-minute action, you use your Persuasion skill to charm a humanoid subject. If they fail a Wisdom save, they suffer the same effect as Charm Person.

Its action type changes to reaction, trigger by incoming damage or debilitation to yourself or a nearby ally.\n- [Energy Specialization](): choose one magical damage type (fire, force, psychic, etc). Gain +1 bonus damage per die with this type.\n- [Permanency](): Choose a Concentration spell that affects you that you can cast. This is now active at all times.\n- [Spell Turning](): When you successfully counter a spell, you turn it back on its caster.\n- [Master of Shaping](): When casting an area spell, you can choose to remove up to 1 square from its area per point of Int bonus.\n- [Innate Power](): Choose any spell you know that has an associated cost (e.g Corruption, Focus, Vitae, etc). You may manifest this power once per short rest without said cost.\n- [Peculiar Element](): Invent a new damage type, that is able to be described as a combination of two types. For instance, you might inflict Blackfire damage, which is a combination of Fire and Necrotic. When inflicting damage with a spell of either type, the damage is of both types; the effect of this is always what is most advantageous to you (for instance, if you inflict Fire/Lightning damage, and the enemy is immune to Fire but vulnerable to Lightning, they are vulnerable to the all of the damage you dealt).\n- [Chain Spell](): you can cast a single-target spell in such a way that it repeats its effect on multiple targets. This is both expensive and difficult to accomplish. Each time you hit with the spell, you can re-target another target within 1 square per Int bonus of the current target, if they haven't already been hit with this casting of the spell. Each subsequent attempt has the same cost as if you cast the spell fresh (but no action cost). If you miss a target, you cannot chain off them. Maximum number of \"bounces\" is equal to your Int bonus.\n- [Contingent Spell](): you can cast a spell in such a way that it does not take effect immediately, but lays dormant in a spell focus that you carry or wear. You decide what will trigger it (e.g. you are about to take damage, you are about to be counterspelled, etc). The spell becomes a reaction with that trigger. All costs are normal. Maximum contingent spells on your person at a time is 1 per Wis bonus.\n- [Dominus](): You are adept at magically controlling minions. The default ability to control any sort of summoned, risen, or conjured minion is however many were conjured by a single casting. With this ability, you can increase that limit to 1 per Charisma bonus. This does not confer any ability to summon multiple minions at a time, or even to summon them at all--you must possess such ability already.\n- [Spell Focus](): You create an item that, when wielded, helps you focus your concentration on spellcasting. When casting a Concentration spell, you can choose to devote the item to the spell. This allows you to maintain the spell as if you were concentrating on it, but your actual concentration remains available if you need it for another spell or action.\n- [Keen Spell](): gain +2 to critical threat range with spells.","bodyHtml":"<p>Every PC gets 1 feat per level, plus a bonus feat at character creation (i.e. level &quot;0&quot;).</p>\n<p>Each <a href=\"./Powers/\">Power Source</a> has its own list of feats you can choose that go well with that power source.

This works similarly to an early 21st century standard flagship phone, with the following differences:\n- The device is extremely resilient (hardness 50, hp 500)\n- The battery lasts forever with no recharging (although it does detect as mildly radioactive)\n- The phone gets a 10 Gbps signal anywhere in the known universe. It is equipped with all known terrestrial and alien encoding protocols to allow hacking of other devices\n- It is coupled with an implant that allows only you to see, hear, and make sense of its outputs. Apart from you, it is a useless brick. The implant also tells you the bearing and direction of the phone at all times, and allows you to remotely detonate it if necessary.\n- In addition to GPS and GLONASS, it has the ability to find its location in space and time almost anywhere in the Universe, as long as the local laws of physics are working correctly.\n- It comes coupled with standard Black Sunglasses, which are of course high-end AR lenses.\n- Axiom is tracking your every move, all the time. Of course.\n\n\n# Apps\n\n## Free Apps\n\n### Face ID\nPoint the phone (or your glasses) at a face, issue a command, and get an ID and full dossier in about a second. Name, address, phone number, employer, salary, blood type, registered voting party, bust size, etc.\n\n## Badge-on-Demand\nProduces a number of digital badges identifying you as a government or law enforcement officer, including:\n- Department of Homeland Security Auxiliary Deputy: useful for interfacing with local and state PDs, the FBI, etc\n- National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, Department 3: surprisingly useful for gaining access to national and state parks, covert extraterrestrial observation posts, and certain military bases\n- Nevada Gaming Commission warrant officer: near unlimited access to any casino, tourist attraction, or \"off-the-books\" gaming facility.\n\n## Petty Cash\nInterfaces with all known digital payment solutions, point-of-sale devices, and ATMs, withdrawn from company funds. The Director will know exactly how much you spent.\n\n## PRISM\nStandard NSA PRISM gateway. Once authenticated, allows you to search records from all compliant internet service providers, corporate databases, and of course government records. Can be used to hack any wireless device (or wired device, using the retractable multi-connector, if close enough), but you still need a Hacking skill to do so.\n\nNo relation to the officer designated \"Prism\".\n\n## Amazon Drone Delivery\nNeed a toaster? A complete 7-disc set of Buffy the Vampire Slayer on Blu-Ray? A package of hot dogs? A loaded AR-15<sup>1</sup>? Amazon Drone Delivery will have your package delivered to your current location<sup>2</sup> (or a desired address) within 30 minutes or...well, there's no penalty if they miss the window, but they usually don't. Axiom members get complementary Rush Service, enjoying a 3d6 minute delivery window within major metropolitan areas!\n\nFootnotes:\n- 1: firearms, recreational drugs, and other hazardous items are prohibited by federal law from delivery via drone, except in the state of Nevada.\n- 2: service is currently only provided on Earth within 15 kilometers of an Amazon drone facility, or on the secret Martian colony that only rich people have access to.\n\n## Pandora\nSiri? Alexa? Cortana? Forget those dinosaurs. Pandora is your state-of-the-art, quantum-computer-based AI assistant. She's smarter than 95% of the humans you've ever met, and knows everything that humanity has ever known. She's ready to assist you at a moment's notice, because she's always listening. And watching. And judging.\n\n## BABEL\nThe BABEL program represents the latest in neuro-linguistic brainwave interface. Rather than muck about with speech-to-text and natural language processing, BABEL simply scans the brain waves of whoever is talking to immediately translate any alien language, including cultural connotations and other context computers just can't hack. Oh, and you don't even need to know the language--BABEL will figure it out in real time, with only a small amount of hilarious mis-translation in the first few, tense moments of First Contact. 99% quality guaranteed!\n\nOnly intelligent minds produce such brain waves, so don't go trying to talk to your goldfish with this (although dolphins might have a thing or two to say).\n\nFor recorded video and audio, brainwave scans are no good, but BABEL can still fall back on a hyper-core quantum processor to make its best guess using NLP for known languages.\n\n\n# Paid Apps\n\nAvailable to requisition using your Axiom Credit Rating!\n\n\n## Neuralizer (1,000 CR)\nUsing what appears to be an ordinary flash for photography, your phone emits a series of extremely rapid pulses of complex electromagnetic radiation, which, when transmitted to the human brain through optic nerves, cause disruption to the hippocampus, effectively wiping out the last 20-30 seconds. For a brief period thereafter, subjects are highly suggestible as to what, in fact, they have just experienced (disadvantage to any relevant saves). This can be disorienting, but has been shown to be mostly harmless in various longitudinal tests.\n\nNote: for longer-term memory modification, a more powerful app is required.\n\n## Memory Patcher (4,000 CR)\nUsing similar light pulses to the Neuralizer, but lasting much longer (at least 3 rounds, see description), the Memory Patcher induces a much deeper state of suggestibility, allowing you to guide the target through the process of rewriting memories to an arbitrary depth.\n\nAt-will, std, range 1; subject is stunned (Wis negates). If they fail three saves within 1 minute, they become helpless and highly suggestible. You may then reprogram their memories (assuming you have a shared language). Roll Int to reprogram:\n- Last few hours: DC 10\n- A single thread of memory for the last few days (e.g. sighting a specific strange creature): DC 15\n- Experiences along a single thread going back into the depths of long-term memory: DC 20\n- If multiple threads, you must repeat the process.\n- Failing by 1 or more causes mental damage to the target (DM discretion). Failing by 10 or more additionally causes the memory alteration to fail.\n- It is possible to learn proficiency in this tool.\n\n## Stun Setting (2,000 CR)\nUsing the \"flash\" of your phone, you can emit a pulse of light that stuns humanoids, beasts, and generally anything with eyes and central nervous system.\n\n- Recharge 33%, std, short range; target is stunned (Con ends).\n\nGreater stun setting (costs 10,000 CR):\n- At-will, std, short range; target is stunned (Con ends).\n- Recharge 33%, std, cone 3; targets are stunned (Con ends).\n\n## Bio-Scanner (1,000 CR)\nUsing the \"camera\" array, the phone can scan a humanoid, animal, or known extraterrestrial inside and out, delivering a comprehensive medical report in just under 3 seconds.\n\n## Clone Scanner (2,000 CR)\nUpgrade to the Bio-Scanner. Once scanned, you can request that Axiom Cloning Labs generate a clone of the creature. While active, the clone costs ACR based on its effectiveness (i.e. CR). It can be programmed to act like the target (using information from the bio-scanner, PRISM, etc; i.e. using Deception), and/or can be modified as you please.\n\nClones take 24 hours to grow, but rush orders can be requested for 2 hour delivery with the Director's approval.\n\n## Thermal Ray (4,000 CR)\nA small emitter in the \"earpiece\" end of the phone can emit a phaser-like beam of energy. \n- At-will, std, short range; beam can cut as effectively as a plasma cutter.\n- At-will, std, ranged; heavy fire damage.\n\n## Inventory Screen (2,000 CR+)\nAn app that shows you all items you've stored in your Axiom Near-Dimensional Adjunct Space. By default, that space is a 3m x 3m x 3m room (climate controlled, standard earth atmosphere, about the size of a standard storage unit or half a one-car garage), with a max of 20 objects. As a bonus action, you can store one held item or retrieve one item. Items transition in and out of the Adjunct Space in a digitization process.\n\nUpgrades:\n- 10x10x5 room, 100 objects, approx 1.5 car garage, transfer up to 3 items at a time: 5,000 CR\n- 50x50x10 warehouse, 1000 objects, transfer any items within circle 5: 10,000 CR\n\n## Wormhole Beacon (5,000 CR)\nThe ultimate ride-hailing app, this creates a beacon for a Hyperspace Conduit generator and notifies Dispatch of your requirements. Within 2d6 rounds, a wormhole will appear, allowing transit of anything that can fit through its 2m aperture back to the high-security Staging Area in an undisclosed location, whereby, after passing necessary security screening and decontamination, you can be routed back to Axiom HQ. Emergency transport is possible with Director approval.\n\nUpgrades:\n- Point-to-point capability: from anywhere to anywhere (that you also have a beacon). 10,000 CR\n- 5m aperture: Add 5,000 CR\n\n## Phototemporal Displacement Engine (4,000 CR)\nUsing the camera and screen in your phone or AR glasses, this device allows you to \"rewind time\", showing you what whatever is in the field of view of your camera (and within 100 meters of its lens) would have looked like within a specified time in the past (any time from Jan 1 1970 CE to the present day). \n\nNote: this is not guaranteed to be accurate, as it involves highly complex quantum calculations to predict physical phenomena. The further back you go, the more inaccurate it is. Similarly, since it is prediction based, it can also attempt to predict the future. This can be...extremely inaccurate...depending on what you're looking at.\n\n## Weather Channel (4,000 CR)\nProvides a wealth of historical data, precise current weather, and extremely accurate predictions going out several years, for any location in the known universe.\n\nMore importantly, it can change the weather. Just click \"edit\", select the desired weather from the dropdown, drag the sliders around, and click \"commit\". Then wait 1d4 x 10 minutes.\n\n## Hologram Generator (2,000 CR+)\nUsing the \"flash\" array, your phone can generate holograms that you can program (or describe to Pandora) to do whatever you want, as long as they fit within a circle 2 and are made entirely of light.\n\nYes, this can be configured as a glamer, as long as the hologram is your size or larger.\n\nUpgrades:\n- Auditory: +1,000 CR (act now to receive Olfactory at no extra charge!)\n- Hard Light: +2,000 CR (holograms can be \"felt\" kind of like haptic feedback; much more believable when touched, but still not \"real\")\n\n## Night-Night Ray (2,000 CR)\nUsing flashing light pulses, your phone causes humanoids, animals, and known extreterrestrials (prone to such things) to become very sleepy, and immediately full unconscious. Only works if they are not already in an agitated state (i.e. alerted to danger).\n\nRecharge 33%, cone 3; subjects fall asleep on a failed Con save. On success, they become sleepy (disadvantage to checks) until they pass another Con save. Alerting subject to danger ends all effects caused by this ray. Otherwise, they will sleep as dictated by their natural rhythyms, at minimum 90 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n# Vehicles\n\n\n# Ground Vehicle Upgrade\n\n## Convenient Optical Pretense (C.O.P) (1,000 CR)\nOptical camouflage system allows your vehicle to appear to be any other vehicle, including an emergency vehicle with valid markings, sirens, lights, etc.\n\n## Unopinionated Tires (2,000 CR)\nMost tires are so opinionated as to which way is \"down\". How droll. These tires could care less. Want to drive on walls? Ceilings? Sure! Just twist the knob to let the tires know. Also, to make things simpler, these tires never directly contact any surface, but cling to a point in space a few millimeters over the average surface grade, which always affords optimal traction in all driving conditions (such as driving up a glass skyscraper, in the rain).\n\n## Grappling Hook (1,000 CR)\nPretty much what the name suggests.\n\n## Bullet-Proof Armor (2,000 CR)\nGrants the vehicle an Armor rating of 20 and hardness 20. Glass is replaced with transparent alloys.\n\n## Weapon Mount (weapon cost)\nCan mount a vehicle-sized weapon such as a 50mm machine gun or rocket launcher, or several personal-sized weapons. Turrets can be AI or manually operated.\n\n\n# Weapons and Tools\n\n\n# Tools\n\n## Plasma Cutter (500 CR)\nA knife-sized blade with a plasma edge, capable of cutting through almost anything.\n\nWeapon stats: one-hand, light, medium thermal, 18/x2.\n\n\n# Military Grade Weapons\n\nWeapon          | CR     | Range      | Damage                  | Critical | Ammo Capacity / Reload   | Special\n----------------|--------|------------|-------------------------|----------| -------------------------|--------\nAssault Rifle   | 1,000  | long range | heavy kinetic           | 19/x3    | 30, bonus/move           | Full Auto, Burst Fire, Semi Auto\nSniper Rifle    | 1,000  | extreme    | heavy kinetic           | 19/x3    | 6, std                   | Semi Auto, Sniper\nRocket Launcher | 2,000  | propelled  | heavy explosive burst 3 | 20/x2    | 1, move                  | Guided\nLaser Pistol    | 1,000  | medium     | medium thermal          | 18/x2    | 20, move                 | Armor Piercing\nLaser Rifle     | 2,000  | long       | heavy thermal           | 18/x2    | 30, move                 | Armor Piercing\nPlasma Sword    | 1,000  | melee      | heavy thermal           | 19/x3    |                          | Armor Piercing, cuts through anything\nMaser           | 1,000  | medium     | medium EM (subdual)     | 18/x2    |                          | Stuns bio and robot targets\n\nSpecials:\n- Semi Auto: no action to reload between shots, even multiple times per round. May be a reload action for a magazine.\n- Burst Fire: as Semi-Auto, but fires 3 rounds per tap. Grants advantage to hit, but does normal damage (on crit, does two additional dice).\n- Full Auto: fires entire magazine in a standard action. Either:\n  - Single target: advantage to hit. For each point above target's AC that you hit, inflict a bonus die of damage.\n  - Sweeping Fire: fires in a cone to extent of range, disadvantage to hit, normal damage.\n- Sniper: if you establish a proper firing position (standard action, immobilizes you), then the Aim action adds +5 to threat range, stacking up to 3 times.\n- Propelled: a propelled projectile flies on its own. By default, it is long range, but it can continue flying well beyond long range, up to one mile (or more if noted). The odds of hitting anything beyond long range cut in half for every 100m or 300 ft, unless guided.\n- Guided: using the Aim action, you can establish a lock. A propelled projectile will guide itself toward the target, granting a +10 bonus to hit.\n- Armor Piercing: ignores armor meant to deflect kinetic damage (most armor on vehicles, structures, and personnel).\n\n\n# Vehicle-size Weapons\nRequires a tripod or car-sized vehicle mount.\n\nWeapon           | CR     | Range      | Damage                     | Critical | Ammo Capacity / Reload   | Special\n-----------------|--------|------------|----------------------------|----------|--------------------------|--------\n50mm Machine Gun | 5,000  | long       | heavy kinetic (x2)         | 19/x3    | 500, std                 | Full Auto\nMissile Launcher | 10,000 | propelled  | heavy explosive burst 5 x2 | 20/x2    | 2, std each              | Guided\n\nTo do:\n- Ammo types for MG, including incendiary, explosive, etc\n\n\n\n\n# Biotech\n\nBrainstorming:\n- Sleep removal\n- Muscle controller\n- Subdermal nano-armor\n- Healing factor\n- Adult supervision\n- In-brain WiFi\n- Neural filter (pain suppression, mental protection, etc)\n- Hyper immunity (poison/disease/drug resist)\n- Stat adds (use s6 gem color system)\n- Fing-longer\n- Yerkes-Dodson Optimizer\n- Artificial Blood Infuser (Sevika's shimmer pump)\n\n\n\n# Implants\n\nThere are three biological systems these implants can interface with. Each system can only safely have one implant applied to it:\n- Psychometabolic System: the system that provides \"power\" to the nervous sytem. While not centralized, it can be augmented, routing additional power where needed.\n- Cerebromotor System: the system that interlinks the CNS with skeletal muscle. Controls reaction speed, reflex, and quickness of wit.\n- Neuroregenerative System: the system that allows the CNS to regulate itself, and, in some cases, regeneration. \n\nThese basal implants provide a certain baseline benefit, but primarily act as an interface for artificial implants that enhance specific functionality.\n\nBaseline benefit grants 2 bonus attribute points to be divided as you wish between 2 candidate attributes. For instance, a psychometabolic implant might grant 4 points to Str/Cha, allowing you to select +2 to each, +4 to one and +0 to the other, +3/+1, etc. To adjust this ratio, please see an Axiom Implant Specialist.\n\nBasal Implant                     | CR     | Baseline Benefit     | Enhancement Slots\n----------------------------------|--------|----------------------|------------------\nPsychometabolic Implant, rank 1   | 1,000  | 2 points, Str/Cha    | 1\nPsychometabolic Implant, rank 2   | 3,000  | 4 points, Str/Cha    | 2\nPsychometabolic Implant, rank 3   | 6,000  | 6 points, Str/Cha    | 3\nPsychometabolic Implant, rank 4   | 10,000 | 8 points, Str/Cha    | 4\nPsychometabolic Implant, rank 5   | 20,000 | 10 points, Str/Cha   | 5\nCerebromotor Implant, rank 1      | 1,000  | 2 points, Dex/Int    | 1\nCerebromotor Implant, rank 2      | 3,000  | 4 points, Dex/Int    | 2\nCerebromotor Implant, rank 3      | 6,000  | 6 points, Dex/Int    | 3\nCerebromotor Implant, rank 4      | 10,000 | 8 points, Dex/Int    | 4\nCerebromotor Implant, rank 5      | 20,000 | 10 points, Dex/Int   | 5\nNeuroregenerative Implant, rank 1 | 1,000  | 2 points, Con/Wis    | 1\nNeuroregenerative Implant, rank 2 | 3,000  | 4 points, Con/Wis    | 2\nNeuroregenerative Implant, rank 3 | 6,000  | 6 points, Con/Wis    | 3\nNeuroregenerative Implant, rank 4 | 10,000 | 8 points, Con/Wis    | 4\nNeuroregenerative Implant, rank 5 | 20,000 | 10 points, Con/Wis   | 5\n\n\n# Psychometabolic Implants\n\nBrainstorm:\n- Iron Fist\n\n## Iron Fist (Psychometabolic, 1 slot, 1,000 CR)\n\n- Unarmed strike inflict heavy kinetic damage\n- Bonus action: add a kinetic charge to next unarmed strike that adds push 5. If subject strikes a wall they take medium kinetic damage from the impact.\n\n## Retractable Blade (Psychometabolic, 1 slot, 1,000 CR)\n\n- Can produce or retract a blade from within your body as a move or bonus action\n- Can be either two medium damage weapons or one heavy damage weapon\n\n## Social Preprocessor (Psychometabolic, 1 slot, 1,000 CR)\n\nHave you ever said \"you too\" after a server told you to enjoy your lunch? Ever mumbled incoherently when asked about your day? Made a fool of yourself trying to ask someone out?\n\nNever again! With the Social Preprocessor, sit back and relax (mentally speaking) while your brain goes on autopilot. Thanks to an AI trained on millions of hours of audio and video of human interactions, the preprocessor knows exactly what to say in any situation. Breeze through hours of small talk at social functions! Ace every interview! Sweep the man/woman/blorgon/etc of your dreams off their feet! And all without feeling anxious and drained after 45 minutes of social exposure.\n\nAlso grants advantage to Charisma checks used for social behavior.\n\n\n## Pheromone Glands (Psychometabolic, 2 slots, 2,000 CR)\n\nThanks to the Ykarrz species, famously able to seduce just about any humanoid in the known universe, Axiom can now synthesize a pheromone that affects humans and a wide variety of humanoids. Depending on intent, the pheromones can produce a powerful sense of community, making the target believe they are part of your \"in\" group, and therefore trust you implicitly; they can also induce other powerful emotions and bodily responses as well.\n\n- Encounter, std, 1 square range; subject humanoid is charmed (Wis neg), incapacitated by bodily infirmity (Con neg), or compelled to satisfy a powerful natural urge (Wis neg).\n\n\n## Command Subroutine Transmitter (Psychometabolic, 3 slots, 5,000 CR)\n\nCommanding minions in battle is taxing, especially when trying to survive enemy fire and make yourself useful at the same time. Why not leave all that to a dedicated computer?\n\nThe CST lets you offload the challenging task of directing the actions of those under your command, transmitting orders to a digital device or another implant, so you don't even need to be in earshot.\n\n- For those who can control minions through summoning/etc, this processor allows you to control 100% more minions than normal.\n\n\n\n# Neuroregenerative Implants\n\n\n## Som-null (Neuroregenerative, 1 slot, 1,000 CR)\n\nWho has time for sleep? Certainly not busy Axiom employees!\n\nThe Som-null implant (credit to Jerry in Accounting for winning the name contest) attaches subprocessors to the limbic system, continually processing long-term memory instead of waiting for a delta wave state. In addition to the benefits of the basal implant, this seems to obviate the need for sleep, relegating it to the dustbin of history!\n\nNote: there have been reports of hallucination, intrusive thoughts, and dimensional displacement for individuals who have gone more than a few days with no sleep. User discretion advised.\n\n\n## Neural Filters (Neuroregerative, 2 slots, 2,000 CR)\n\nThis set of preprocessors analyzes incoming sensory input before allowing it to proceed to the brain. Useful data? Go right on in! Distracting pain? Discomfort? Psychic intrusion? Nah, you'll have to wait outside.\n\n- Nullifies pain-based effects\n- Advantage to save against charm, confusion, any form of sensory or emotional intrusion\n  - On failure, effects still do not take place, but you are unable to act while they would otherwise be in effect\n- Does not block the telepathic reading of thoughts, as this does not use the sensory input system\n\n\n## Healing Factor (Neuroregenerative, 2 slots, 2,000 CR)\n\n- Allows you to take a short rest as a bonus action once per encounter\n\n\n\n## Intradermal Nano-Armor (Neuroregenerative, variable slots)\n\nBuilt-in armor!\n\nSlots | CR     | Armor  | Other\n------|--------|--------|------\n1     | 1,000  | +4     | \n2     | 3,000  | +8     | Resist (critical/sneak attack damage)\n3     | 6,000  | +12    | Resist (all nonmagical weapons)\n\n\n\n\n\n# Cybertech\n\n\n# TITAN Armor System\n\nNobody wants to lose a limb just to get a cool gun attachment or something. (I mean chainsaw, yeah, of course, but gun? Meh.)\n\nThat's why Axiom has perfected the Adjunct-Attached Extra Corpus Augmentation System! By means of extradimensional Adjunct-Space, you can store the bulky, unwieldy parts of your cybernetics in a convenient pocket dimension and just wrap the rest around your body for the full cybernetic experience without all the fuss of immunosuppressants and giant bolts through in your bone marrow!\n\nYou might ask, \"isn't this just armor and not cybernetics\"?\n\nShut up. You get to be Iron Man. Don't ruin this with logic.\n\n\n# Base Modules\n\nThe system requires a base unit, usually worn on the torso (for torsoed individuals). The base unit provides power, internal structure, and connection points for modules.\n\nMore advanced base units provide more power and have more module slots.\n\n\nBase Module | ACR | Power | AC^1^  | Module Slots   | Special\n------------|-----|-------|--------|----------------|--------\nMark I      | 50  | 1     | 16+Dex | 2              |\nMark II     | 150 | 3     | 17+Dex | 3              | \nMark III    | 300 | 5     | 18+Dex | 3+1 high power |\nMark IV     | 450 | 7     | 19+Dex | 4+1 high power |\nMark V      | 600 | 9     | 20+Dex | 4+2 high power |\n\n\nNotes:\n- 1: AC listed requires that armor is fully deployed. If you leave out the helmet to look cool on screen (or to not weird people out), you suffer a -2 to AC.\n\n\n# Modules\n\n\n## Flight Module\n- (50 / 1 slot): fly 50 ft, max 5 rds, recharges in 5 minutes.\n- (100 / 2 slots): fly 100 ft (accel 100%/rd), max 5 minutes, recharges in 5 minutes.\n- (200 / 1 high power slot): fly 100 ft unlimited; overland flight at Mach 2.\n\n## Defense Modules\n- (50 / 1 slot): nano-adaptive armor. Adds +2 AC, immune to armor penetration, adds hardness 10.\n- (100 / 1 slot): ablative armor coating. Adds ablate 10%, max 3 times per encounter.\n- (100 / 1 slot): reflective armor. Adds 25% chance to reflect electromagnetic or ionized thermal (i.e. plasma) attacks, even if magical in origin.\n\n- force shield projector\n\n\n## Weapon Modules\n- (50 / 1 slot): Hand Blasters. Because of course you want them. Ranged, at-will, std; medium thermal damage dual wielded, or one target heavy damage..\n- (100 / 1 slot): Missile Launcher. Fires 5 auto-seeking missiles as a bonus action (magic missile).\n\n- freeze ray\n- maser\n- net launcher\n- gravity bomb\n- plasma sword\n- etc\n\n## Utility Modules\n\n- Optical Camouflage\n- Grappling Hook?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Dev Notes\n\nCategories:\n- Vehicles and vehicle mods\n- Phone apps\n- Weapons\n- Armor\n- Biotech\n- Cybertech\n- Alien\n\nAxiom Credit Rating:\n- A number from 0 to 1000 (or more?)\n- Everything from the Axiom Store you \"own\" counts against this limit\n- You can freely upgrade and exchange items\n\nCost guidelines:\n- Spell at will: 100 per level\n  - Recharge 33%: half\n  - Encounter: quarter\n- Magic item:\n  - Uncommon: 100\n  - Rare: 250\n  - Very Rare: 500\n  - Legendary: 750","bodyHtml":"<h1>Phones</h1>\n<p>Issued at level 1.</p>\n<p>Everyone is issued a standard galactic phone.

Rather than muck about with speech-to-text and natural language processing, BABEL simply scans the brain waves of whoever is talking to immediately translate any alien language, including cultural connotations and other context computers just can't hack. Oh, and you don't even need to know the language--BABEL will figure it out in real time, with only a small amount of hilarious mis-translation in the first few, tense moments of First Contact. 99% quality guaranteed!</p>\n<p>Only intelligent minds produce such brain waves, so don't go trying to talk to your goldfish with this (although dolphins might have a thing or two to say).</p>\n<p>For recorded video and audio, brainwave scans are no good, but BABEL can still fall back on a hyper-core quantum processor to make its best guess using NLP for known languages.</p>\n<h1>Paid Apps</h1>\n<p>Available to requisition using your Axiom Credit Rating!</p>\n<h2>Neuralizer (1,000 CR)</h2>\n<p>Using what appears to be an ordinary flash for photography, your phone emits a series of extremely rapid pulses of complex electromagnetic radiation, which, when transmitted to the human brain through optic nerves, cause disruption to the hippocampus, effectively wiping out the last 20-30 seconds. For a brief period thereafter, subjects are highly suggestible as to what, in fact, they have just experienced (disadvantage to any relevant saves). This can be disorienting, but has been shown to be mostly harmless in various longitudinal tests.</p>\n<p>Note: for longer-term memory modification, a more powerful app is required.</p>\n<h2>Memory Patcher (4,000 CR)</h2>\n<p>Using similar light pulses to the Neuralizer, but lasting much longer (at least 3 rounds, see description), the Memory Patcher induces a much deeper state of suggestibility, allowing you to guide the target through the process of rewriting memories to an arbitrary depth.</p>\n<p>At-will, std, range 1; subject is stunned (Wis negates).

It can be programmed to act like the target (using information from the bio-scanner, PRISM, etc; i.e. using Deception), and/or can be modified as you please.</p>\n<p>Clones take 24 hours to grow, but rush orders can be requested for 2 hour delivery with the Director's approval.</p>\n<h2>Thermal Ray (4,000 CR)</h2>\n<p>A small emitter in the &quot;earpiece&quot; end of the phone can emit a phaser-like beam of energy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At-will, std, short range; beam can cut as effectively as a plasma cutter.</li>\n<li>At-will, std, ranged; heavy fire damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Inventory Screen (2,000 CR+)</h2>\n<p>An app that shows you all items you've stored in your Axiom Near-Dimensional Adjunct Space. By default, that space is a 3m x 3m x 3m room (climate controlled, standard earth atmosphere, about the size of a standard storage unit or half a one-car garage), with a max of 20 objects. As a bonus action, you can store one held item or retrieve one item. Items transition in and out of the Adjunct Space in a digitization process.</p>\n<p>Upgrades:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>10x10x5 room, 100 objects, approx 1.5 car garage, transfer up to 3 items at a time: 5,000 CR</li>\n<li>50x50x10 warehouse, 1000 objects, transfer any items within circle 5: 10,000 CR</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Wormhole Beacon (5,000 CR)</h2>\n<p>The ultimate ride-hailing app, this creates a beacon for a Hyperspace Conduit generator and notifies Dispatch of your requirements. Within 2d6 rounds, a wormhole will appear, allowing transit of anything that can fit through its 2m aperture back to the high-security Staging Area in an undisclosed location, whereby, after passing necessary security screening and decontamination, you can be routed back to Axiom HQ. Emergency transport is possible with Director approval.</p>\n<p>Upgrades:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Point-to-point capability: from anywhere to anywhere (that you also have a beacon). 10,000 CR</li>\n<li>5m aperture: Add 5,000 CR</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Phototemporal Displacement Engine (4,000 CR)</h2>\n<p>Using the camera and screen in your phone or AR glasses, this device allows you to &quot;rewind time&quot;, showing you what whatever is in the field of view of your camera (and within 100 meters of its lens) would have looked like within a specified time in the past (any time from Jan 1 1970 CE to the present day).</p>\n<p>Note: this is not guaranteed to be accurate, as it involves highly complex quantum calculations to predict physical phenomena. The further back you go, the more inaccurate it is. Similarly, since it is prediction based, it can also attempt to predict the future. This can be...extremely inaccurate...depending on what you're looking at.</p>\n<h2>Weather Channel (4,000 CR)</h2>\n<p>Provides a wealth of historical data, precise current weather, and extremely accurate predictions going out several years, for any location in the known universe.</p>\n<p>More importantly, it can change the weather. Just click &quot;edit&quot;, select the desired weather from the dropdown, drag the sliders around, and click &quot;commit&quot;. Then wait 1d4 x 10 minutes.</p>\n<h2>Hologram Generator (2,000 CR+)</h2>\n<p>Using the &quot;flash&quot; array, your phone can generate holograms that you can program (or describe to Pandora) to do whatever you want, as long as they fit within a circle 2 and are made entirely of light.</p>\n<p>Yes, this can be configured as a glamer, as long as the hologram is your size or larger.</p>\n<p>Upgrades:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Auditory: +1,000 CR (act now to receive Olfactory at no extra charge!)</li>\n<li>Hard Light: +2,000 CR (holograms can be &quot;felt&quot; kind of like haptic feedback; much more believable when touched, but still not &quot;real&quot;)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Night-Night Ray (2,000 CR)</h2>\n<p>Using flashing light pulses, your phone causes humanoids, animals, and known extreterrestrials (prone to such things) to become very sleepy, and immediately full unconscious. Only works if they are not already in an agitated state (i.e. alerted to danger).</p>\n<p>Recharge 33%, cone 3; subjects fall asleep on a failed Con save. On success, they become sleepy (disadvantage to checks) until they pass another Con save. Alerting subject to danger ends all effects caused by this ray. Otherwise, they will sleep as dictated by their natural rhythyms, at minimum 90 minutes.</p>\n<h1>Vehicles</h1>\n<h1>Ground Vehicle Upgrade</h1>\n<h2>Convenient Optical Pretense (C.O.P) (1,000 CR)</h2>\n<p>Optical camouflage system allows your vehicle to appear to be any other vehicle, including an emergency vehicle with valid markings, sirens, lights, etc.</p>\n<h2>Unopinionated Tires (2,000 CR)</h2>\n<p>Most tires are so opinionated as to which way is &quot;down&quot;. How droll. These tires could care less. Want to drive on walls? Ceilings? Sure! Just twist the knob to let the tires know. Also, to make things simpler, these tires never directly contact any surface, but cling to a point in space a few millimeters over the average surface grade, which always affords optimal traction in all driving conditions (such as driving up a glass skyscraper, in the rain).</p>\n<h2>Grappling Hook (1,000 CR)</h2>\n<p>Pretty much what the name suggests.</p>\n<h2>Bullet-Proof Armor (2,000 CR)</h2>\n<p>Grants the vehicle an Armor rating of 20 and hardness 20. Glass is replaced with transparent alloys.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Mount (weapon cost)</h2>\n<p>Can mount a vehicle-sized weapon such as a 50mm machine gun or rocket launcher, or several personal-sized weapons. Turrets can be AI or manually operated.</p>\n<h1>Weapons and Tools</h1>\n<h1>Tools</h1>\n<h2>Plasma Cutter (500 CR)</h2>\n<p>A knife-sized blade with a plasma edge, capable of cutting through almost anything.</p>\n<p>Weapon stats: one-hand, light, medium thermal, 18/x2.</p>\n<h1>Military Grade Weapons</h1>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Weapon</th>\n<th>CR</th>\n<th>Range</th>\n<th>Damage</th>\n<th>Critical</th>\n<th>Ammo Capacity / Reload</th>\n<th>Special</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Assault Rifle</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>long range</td>\n<td>heavy kinetic</td>\n<td>19/x3</td>\n<td>30, bonus/move</td>\n<td>Full Auto, Burst Fire, Semi Auto</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sniper Rifle</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>extreme</td>\n<td>heavy kinetic</td>\n<td>19/x3</td>\n<td>6, std</td>\n<td>Semi Auto, Sniper</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rocket Launcher</td>\n<td>2,000</td>\n<td>propelled</td>\n<td>heavy explosive burst 3</td>\n<td>20/x2</td>\n<td>1, move</td>\n<td>Guided</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Laser Pistol</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>medium</td>\n<td>medium thermal</td>\n<td>18/x2</td>\n<td>20, move</td>\n<td>Armor Piercing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Laser Rifle</td>\n<td>2,000</td>\n<td>long</td>\n<td>heavy thermal</td>\n<td>18/x2</td>\n<td>30, move</td>\n<td>Armor Piercing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Plasma Sword</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>melee</td>\n<td>heavy thermal</td>\n<td>19/x3</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>Armor Piercing, cuts through anything</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Maser</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>medium</td>\n<td>medium EM (subdual)</td>\n<td>18/x2</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>Stuns bio and robot targets</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Specials:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Semi Auto: no action to reload between shots, even multiple times per round.

While not centralized, it can be augmented, routing additional power where needed.</li>\n<li>Cerebromotor System: the system that interlinks the CNS with skeletal muscle. Controls reaction speed, reflex, and quickness of wit.</li>\n<li>Neuroregenerative System: the system that allows the CNS to regulate itself, and, in some cases, regeneration.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These basal implants provide a certain baseline benefit, but primarily act as an interface for artificial implants that enhance specific functionality.</p>\n<p>Baseline benefit grants 2 bonus attribute points to be divided as you wish between 2 candidate attributes. For instance, a psychometabolic implant might grant 4 points to Str/Cha, allowing you to select +2 to each, +4 to one and +0 to the other, +3/+1, etc. To adjust this ratio, please see an Axiom Implant Specialist.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Basal Implant</th>\n<th>CR</th>\n<th>Baseline Benefit</th>\n<th>Enhancement Slots</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Psychometabolic Implant, rank 1</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>2 points, Str/Cha</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Psychometabolic Implant, rank 2</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>4 points, Str/Cha</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Psychometabolic Implant, rank 3</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>6 points, Str/Cha</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Psychometabolic Implant, rank 4</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n<td>8 points, Str/Cha</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Psychometabolic Implant, rank 5</td>\n<td>20,000</td>\n<td>10 points, Str/Cha</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cerebromotor Implant, rank 1</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>2 points, Dex/Int</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cerebromotor Implant, rank 2</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>4 points, Dex/Int</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cerebromotor Implant, rank 3</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>6 points, Dex/Int</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cerebromotor Implant, rank 4</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n<td>8 points, Dex/Int</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cerebromotor Implant, rank 5</td>\n<td>20,000</td>\n<td>10 points, Dex/Int</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Neuroregenerative Implant, rank 1</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>2 points, Con/Wis</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Neuroregenerative Implant, rank 2</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>4 points, Con/Wis</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Neuroregenerative Implant, rank 3</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>6 points, Con/Wis</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Neuroregenerative Implant, rank 4</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n<td>8 points, Con/Wis</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Neuroregenerative Implant, rank 5</td>\n<td>20,000</td>\n<td>10 points, Con/Wis</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1>Psychometabolic Implants</h1>\n<p>Brainstorm:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Iron Fist</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Iron Fist (Psychometabolic, 1 slot, 1,000 CR)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Unarmed strike inflict heavy kinetic damage</li>\n<li>Bonus action: add a kinetic charge to next unarmed strike that adds push 5.

With the Social Preprocessor, sit back and relax (mentally speaking) while your brain goes on autopilot. Thanks to an AI trained on millions of hours of audio and video of human interactions, the preprocessor knows exactly what to say in any situation.

This is useful for establishing legacy abilities. Further abilities must be purchased using feats and powers gained through leveling.\n\nTo gain a legacy, you opt in to a chosen legacy's basic state, which is typically level-neutral (any advantages it grants are offset by disadvantages). You can choose to have no legacy. You can have multiple, but only at the DM's discretion.\n\nSome legacies have \"negative\" powers which impart disadvatanges, but allow you to select more powers in kind. These can be selected at character creation, or when leveling up and selecting new Legacy powers.\n\nQuick example:\n- The Vampire legacy grants:\n  - Ability score bonuses (net positive)\n  - Undead traits (minor negative)\n  - Vulnerability to sunlight and magical thresholds (major negative)\n  - Blood mechanic (net neutral)\n  - Access to a variety of feats and powers\n- The Chosen One legacy grants:\n  - Ability score bonuses (net positive)\n  - A guiding force NPC, magic item, voice in your head, etc (neutral)\n  - Obligations to perform a sacred duty (net negative)\n\n\n\n\n\n# Old, class-based version\n\nAll D&D races gone. As is the word \"race\".\n\nEach level represents either training or innate ability. I suppose you could say there are two Classes in the game, one representing each.\n\nLevels of training grant 1 Feat, as mentioned.\n\nInnate ability should total 0 at 1st level, but it can do so by balancing useful abilities with disadvantages.\n\nExamples:\n\n# Sylvans\n- (+1 level) gain +2 to two ability scores or +4 to one ability score.\n- (+1 level) gain the ability to Fey Step (recharge 33%, move, ranged, teleport within line of sight)\n- (+1 level) gain the ability to Charm (recharge 33%, std, range; subject is charmed, Cha ends, ends automatically or fails immediately if you or obvious ally is hostile)\n- (+1 level) gain the ability to summon a minor animal to aid you (e.g. rat, owl, fox)\n- (+2 level) gain a powerful animal or plant like form you can shift into for a limited time\n- (-1 level) you physically cannot speak a direct lie. You can exaggerate, or mislead, or use weasel worlds, but direct, factual lies are impossible.\n- (-2 levels) you are obligated to honor any deal, bargain, or promise made, even if it is not in your favor.\n- (-3 levels) you are vulnerable to iron and iron-based weapon attacks. You cannot wield iron weapons or wear iron armor.\n\n# Netherkind\n- (+1 level) gain +2 to two ability scores or +4 to one ability score.\n- (+1 level) Resist (necrotic)\n- (-1 level) Vulnerable (radiant)\n- (+2 levels) Blood Drain: you have a bite attack inflicting 1d4 Con damage. Drained blood can reduce any Con damage you might have, or otherwise grant temporary Con (up to 10 higher than normal).\n- (-2 levels) Blood Addiction: you must feed on blood to survive. Your subjects must be of the same phenotype as you (e.g., in most cases, natural humanoids). You lose 2 points of Con every day simply existing. Food is tasty, but does not slake your blood hunger. You must have the Blood Drain ability in order to feed. If your Con drops below 10, you must pass a Wis save (DC = 10 + amount Con is below normal) every time you have the opportunity to feed, if you do not wish to. If your Con drops 10 points below normal, or below 4, you lose control of your character, as they drop all inhibitions and pursue feeding until max Con is reached.\n- (+2 levels) Regeneration: (requires Blood Drain) At the beginning of each round, even if you are otherwise unable to take actions, you can choose to exchange Con points to remove Wounds. Every 2 Con points removes 1 Wound per level. This automatically stabilizes you if you were unstable, and allows you to re-roll your Con check to determine if you are disabled or merely bloody. If dying, this ability does not restore your ability to act, unless it reduces your Wounds to 0.\n- (-2 levels) Sunlight Vulnerability: Each round you spend in natural sunlight, you suffer 10 Wounds. This occurs if any portion of your body is exposed to the light.\n- (-1 levels) Holy Ward: You cannot cross the threshold of a sanctified place or the home of a mortal without invitation. If you find yourself inside one, you must spend all actions to exit as quickly as possible. If a living creature presents you with a holy symbol in which they possess true faith, you cannot approach closer to them voluntarily.\n\nOther vampire abilities are generally +1 level.\n\n\n\n# The World\n\nLike 3e, this system has an Implied Setting. Effectively, that means it has everything a normal setting has except a map. More specifically:\n- It has \"races\" (though not the traditional ones), and rules for making your own\n- It has places (interesting towns, dungeons, ruins, etc), but you decided where they are\n- It has a few gods and other powers, and rules for making your own\n- It has a prevailing magic system that explains magic users, powerful beings, etc\n- It has a socioeconomic and political reality that allows for adventurers\n- It has a magic item economy\n- It has a medieval fantasy aesthetic, with a few things from other settings (i.e. artifice, automata), but not full-blown Steampunk (but it can be)\n- Everything in it is portable to other worlds\n\n\n# People\nThe words \"race\", \"races\", and \"racial\" shall not appear in the work. The section that describes the innate abilities of PCs and NPCs shall be called People, and it will explain all of the People in the setting.\n\n> We have heard of worlds where magic hides, and must be teased out through rigorous study, and purchased dearly from the world's life force. We have seen visages of worlds where magic flows too freely, and is tamed and weaponized, perverted in its purpose, until all life is drained from the world by one means or another. This is not our world.\n> \n> Our world sits in the balance between Aether and Nether. Above, the Aether stirs, ever creative, blossoming into existence from nothing. In its pure form, it is power, and potential, and all things--but far too potent for mortals. The Aether is the realm of the Divine. But Aether does not last forever. It decays--some say it evolves--but the transition is permanent. Aether becomes Fire, or Earth, or Life. It becomes the air we breathe, the water we drink. It becomes the complex elements that form the biosphere, and the simple energies that make the elements vital. And, at long last, when matter and energy have expired, they decay once more, descending into the Nether, from which they will never return.\n> \n> The many elements and energies of our world keep it vital and diverse. Minerals, plants, and animals exist in abundance, all aligning with one element or another, or several, or even an ever-changing preference. And so, too, does intelligent and sentient life form its clades and niches. The many peoples of our world all have a favorite element or two, or a guiding energy that unites them. The Sylvans, full of Life, are similar to the many animals and plants of the surface world, but with the advantage of speech, tools, and complex society. The Elementals dwell where pure elemental energies ebb--in the earth's crust, in pools of fire, in deepest ocean, amidst the clouds, etc.\n> \n> It is even said that, beyond our world, others peoples live similar lives. The Devi are the peoples of Aether, kin to the gods themselves. Below, the Netherkin scrape some sort of existence together in a realm of eternal decay. Some clever folk have even engineered new energies, distinct from those of nature: Artifice makes wonderful toys, and terrible weapons, and even a new sort of people: the Automata. Similarly, not all people agree on how magic ought to be used, and some have used it--intentionally or otherwise--to warp natural people and creatures into something nature never intended: the Divergent.\n> \n> But people are as people do. No one element or energy is right, and none is wrong. People do good, and bad, and they change their minds. No one sits in judgment. There are godly beings, every one with a story to tell of their exploits, their virtues and vices, but there is no consensus as to who is right and who is wrong, for people believe what they wish to believe. Religions are as numerous as any other invention of people--they are an attempt to understand a Universe which is more complex, beautiful, and awesome than any work of words has ever captured. There is more mystery in the Earth and the Heavens than may ever be explored.\n\n\nGods:\n- Each ethnic group has a \"pantheon\" of sorts. Each pantheon is an entirely different approach to religion.\n- Sylvan gods are beings like Wolf, Eagle, Bear, etc, and a more powerful and distant class such as Sky, Moon, and Mother (the world itself). They don't do a lot of judging. The religion believes in constant reincarnation, without a karmic system--after all, natural is self-balancing. Sometimes you're the predator, sometimes you're the prey.\n- Elemental gods are simply the most powerful elemental beings in a given area. There is no separate world in which elementals exist. Elementals are also ageless, and are absorbed into their element when they die (preferably), so there is no afterlife. Sadly, many Elementals are destroyed in order to harvest elemental crystals. This is frowned upon.\n\n\nHumans:\n- More sort of the \"mutts\" of the world. Some consider themselves \"pure\", but the reality is they are the genetic \"average\" of all the more extreme forms of humanoid out there. Different stories are told of origins--some even prefer that humans arrived from elsewhere, perhaps via lost magicks or technology--a reason for some to pursue such knowledge with zeal and even abandon.\n\n\n# Magic\n\nSo Aether becomes elements and energy. More specifically, all those twinkly white things in the sky are explosions of Aether, pure and white, devolving into matter and energy spewed in every direction. Some time ago, perhaps at the direction of gods, this world was woven together from many elements and energies. Other worlds may even exist, somewhere out in the Cosmos.\n\nBut what is magic, then? Well, magic is just a continuum of possibility in a Universe where more energies exist than in ours. While thermal and electromagnetic potential exist in both Universes, only in this one does pure Fire, Air, or Life energy bind itself to matter. And thus, said energies can be coaxed apart, and formed into something useful.\n\nThe most traditional magicks are probably those of the Sylvan and Elemental peoples, at least before the increase in the complexity of civilization over the last few thousand years. For long eons prior, Sylvans and Elementals practiced traditional arts that could be called \"magic\". \n\nSylvan \"magic\" is mainly incorporated into their forms, which can grow and evolve in power as they become more potent. The more esoteric and \"magicky\" of their arts are those involving the Spirit Realm, a coterminous space (or an extension of existing space that others cannot see). Within the context of ancient Sylvan life, this might not even be considered magic at all--although these days, only a small few practice the ancient ways.\n\nElemental magic is a bit more obvious, albeit restricted to the spaces and times where the energy abounds. Within nodes of elemental power, Elementals can create many effects in line with the energy they are using. Far away from such sources, they must draw on their own internal energy, which can diminish them quickly.\n\nSo is that it? What of robed wizards animating brooms? Broom-riding witches brewing potions in cauldrons?\n\nWell, apart from things that are decidedly *not* spellcasting such as Alchemy, such magic definitely exists, and is the result of careful study and experimentation by many generations of clever practitioners (of varying ethical persuasions).\n\nThe mechanisms by which a Sylvan might call upon natural power to change their form, or by which an Elemental might cause Earth to roil or Fire to blaze, were once mysterious. Through study, practitioners have made them less so. Given that all elements and energies have a natural affinity, it becomes possible to create tools to help create overt magical effects.\n\nFor instance, a tree is a fairly advanced form of Life energy, so a branch of that tree can be used to manipulate said energy. Staves and wands are a common sight among those who wish to wield the energies of Life. Elementalism is really quite simple: earth is earth, water is water, etc. If one wishes to control fire, one needs some fire to control. Older schools of elementalism deal exclusively with manipulating what already exists in nature, and is at hand. In times past, fire elementalists would not be caught outside without a burning brazier, firebrand, or some such source of their preferred element.\n\nBut we mustn't forget that all things come from Aether, which means there exists a primeval source for any desired energy. Perhaps the greatest discovery of the magical arts--certainly the most disruptive--was that the Aether, long known not to have any direct affinity with any known physical object, does in fact have affinity with complex thought-forms: words, symbols, mathematics, geometry, etc. Careful, exhaustive study of the appearance of abstract logic in nature (e.g. hexagons in beehives, crystalline structures in rock, the golden ratio, etc) eventually yielded the unifying theorem: how abstract, otherwise unreal structures that seem only to exist in the mind ultimately link with the Aether above. And so, mages learned to call upon Aether to create their own energies.\n\n(This has been the subject of much criticism)","bodyHtml":"<h1>New version, in brief</h1>\n<p>Everyone gets a bonus feat and a bonus power at level 0.

For long eons prior, Sylvans and Elementals practiced traditional arts that could be called &quot;magic&quot;.</p>\n<p>Sylvan &quot;magic&quot; is mainly incorporated into their forms, which can grow and evolve in power as they become more potent. The more esoteric and &quot;magicky&quot; of their arts are those involving the Spirit Realm, a coterminous space (or an extension of existing space that others cannot see). Within the context of ancient Sylvan life, this might not even be considered magic at all--although these days, only a small few practice the ancient ways.</p>\n<p>Elemental magic is a bit more obvious, albeit restricted to the spaces and times where the energy abounds. Within nodes of elemental power, Elementals can create many effects in line with the energy they are using. Far away from such sources, they must draw on their own internal energy, which can diminish them quickly.</p>\n<p>So is that it? What of robed wizards animating brooms? Broom-riding witches brewing potions in cauldrons?</p>\n<p>Well, apart from things that are decidedly <em>not</em> spellcasting such as Alchemy, such magic definitely exists, and is the result of careful study and experimentation by many generations of clever practitioners (of varying ethical persuasions).</p>\n<p>The mechanisms by which a Sylvan might call upon natural power to change their form, or by which an Elemental might cause Earth to roil or Fire to blaze, were once mysterious. Through study, practitioners have made them less so. Given that all elements and energies have a natural affinity, it becomes possible to create tools to help create overt magical effects.</p>\n<p>For instance, a tree is a fairly advanced form of Life energy, so a branch of that tree can be used to manipulate said energy. Staves and wands are a common sight among those who wish to wield the energies of Life. Elementalism is really quite simple: earth is earth, water is water, etc. If one wishes to control fire, one needs some fire to control. Older schools of elementalism deal exclusively with manipulating what already exists in nature, and is at hand. In times past, fire elementalists would not be caught outside without a burning brazier, firebrand, or some such source of their preferred element.</p>\n<p>But we mustn't forget that all things come from Aether, which means there exists a primeval source for any desired energy. Perhaps the greatest discovery of the magical arts--certainly the most disruptive--was that the Aether, long known not to have any direct affinity with any known physical object, does in fact have affinity with complex thought-forms: words, symbols, mathematics, geometry, etc. Careful, exhaustive study of the appearance of abstract logic in nature (e.g. hexagons in beehives, crystalline structures in rock, the golden ratio, etc) eventually yielded the unifying theorem: how abstract, otherwise unreal structures that seem only to exist in the mind ultimately link with the Aether above. And so, mages learned to call upon Aether to create their own energies.</p>\n<p>(This has been the subject of much criticism)</p>\n","metadata":null,"transformedMetadata":"default transform"},{"name":"Legacy","contents":"Legacy is a system for describing power you were born with, or otherwise come into as a birthright.\n\nRather than proscribing specific \"races\"--which is considered to be outside the scope of this sytem, and better implemented in individual settings or campaigns, if at all--this system provides broad categories of legacy which should be applicable to a wide variety of campaign settings.\n\nLegacy Group | Magical Affinity | Description\n------------ | ---------------- | -----------\nSylvans      | Nature           | Animal/plant/fey qualities, harmonious with nature\nElementals   | Elemental        | Of the world, but not of flesh (think djinn, efreet)\nDeva         | Radiant/Holy     | The race of gods, but not gods themselves.

Netherkin consume energy from \"positive energy\" beings in order to survive. There are as many ways to do this as their are phenotypes--some drink blood, some drain souls, some sap mental energy, some devour memories--that's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThey should not be described as \"undead\", as, more so than any other factor, that word has lost all meaning. They are animate, they are conscious, they have minds, they have bodies (except the incorporeal ones, but even so), they can cease to exist, they can even be restored to function after ceasing to exist, given the right magic. In what way are they not \"alive\"? Nobody has defined the term well. The fact that they subsist on positive energy, and cannot generate it on their own, is a much clearer delination than any other. It is unique to their kind.\n\nEvery Netherkin must take an ability that explains how they get their energy (although feel free to take more than one). It is simply not possible for them to survive by eating and drinking, or soaking up sunlight, or bathing in elemental energy. If that were possible, they wouldn't be Netherkin, they'd be any of the other many Legacy options.\n\nThere is something inherently magical about devouring positive energy. It is not something that simple physics and chemistry can explain. The energy a human can get from drinking another human's blood is pretty miniscule--the energy a Hemovore gets from just a few second's feeding is vastly more than a normal human can absorb in the largest feast after hours of digestion. Apart from explanations involving nuclear decay or mass-energy conversion--which this Legacy type does not use--it is clearly not the physical energy of their \"food\" that is being absorbed.\n\nConsequently, Netherkin generally have very powerful physical abilities derived from the excess energy they consume. Their forms are able to store and utilize more energy than a human possibly could. Thus, their essential abilities tend to come with many advantages, countered by a great many disadvantages. An effort is made to keep both to a minimum, so the PC can customize beyond that minimum, but certain advantages are considered essential. For example: a vampire must be able to drink blood, and must be vulnerable to sunlight and holy energy.

While this arrangement is not unheard of, it rarely results in a long and lucrative career for the Invoker. Anybody can sell their soul--that doesn't make them a Invoker. Instead, the wise Invoker follows the Principle of Equal Exchange, the fundamental law of the Pact. In essence, all Outsiders, regardless of outward appearance or presumed morality, are supernaturally bound to honor contracts and deals, and when a debt is repaid, it is repaid. The devil is, of course, in the details, and thus the true measure of a successful Invoker is whether they can harness the power of Outsiders without becoming hopelessly entrapped by them.\n\nOf course, it is hardly uncommon for a Invoker not to have some sort of debt or kinship he can't easily rid himself of, and this is handled separately. As a rule, Invoker spells and rituals are self-balancing and do not imply permanent debt, while [[#Corruption]] results when a Invoker, wittingly or otherwise, permanently exchanges some sort of debt or bondage in exchange for power.\n\n\n# Basic Abilities\n\n<!--\nAttribute     | Value\n---------     | -----\nHit Die       | d8\nHP/level      | 5\nWeapon Prof.  | None\nArmor Prof.   | None\nSaving Throws | Int, Cha\n-->\n\nBrief version:\n- Your primary limiting factor is Corruption, an attribute describing how much your planar powers have corrupted your soul. You gain it by using expensive powers, and reduce it by either purifying yourself or coercing others into accepting some of it. You can gain a lot of power by accepting permanent Corruption.\n- Summons: corruption-free, loyal extraplanar minions that you can improve with feats.\n- Bindings: permanent or at-will magical abilities that generally don't cause corruption to use, because you already accepted permanent corruption to gain them.\n- Invocations: spell-like abilities which generally cause corruption, but are quite powerful.\n\n\n# Core skills\n- Spellcraft (Int): used to conduct invocation rituals, such as summoning, banishing, or commanding extraplanar creatures.\n- Concentration (Wis): used to resist Corruption.\n- Willpower (Cha): your ability to command loyalty or otherwise impose your will upon extraplanar creatures.\n\nUses:\n- Spellcraft\n  - Detect planar alignment: detects extraplanar creatures, portals, extraplanar magical effects. Determine planar origin of same.\n  - Magic circle: creates a magical barrier for containing extraplanar creatures, or protecting yourself from same.\n  - Summon outsider: summons an extraplanar creature.\n  - Command outsider: subjects an extraplanar creature to your will.\n  - Banish outsider: sends an extraplanar creature back to its home plane.\n- Concentration\n  - Resist Corruption\n- Willpower\n  - Used during Summon, Command, and Banish\n  - Determines most abilities of bound minions\n  - \n\n\n# Corruption\n- Minimum: 0\n- Threshold: 1/2 level + Wis\n\nBelow the threshold, Corruption has no in-game effect (but may have several minor cosmetic effects). When at or above the threshold, you must pass Concentration checks each time you gain Corruption, and at certain other times determined by the DM.\n\nA Concentration check's DC is equal to 10 + your Corruption.\n- Complete success: no effect.\n- Mixed success: you are Tempted, a state the DM can take advantage of at a later time.\n- Failure: you are Tainted. At any time, the DM can attempt to compel you into an action you might not have otherwise willed.\n\nWhen \"Tempted\", the DM can, at an opportune time, offer you a deal on behalf of the planar forces from which you gain power. This must be at a time when your character would be reasonably willing to borrow power for some worthwhile gain. The deal is generally the same as any other action you might have taken: for a given Corruption cost, you gain a certain effect. However, the power can be something you couldn't normally access, or have a powerful enhancement such as using it while you are incapacitated, or as an immediate action, or having empowered effect. In any case, you must pass a Concentration check to resist (you can voluntarily fail if you choose). If you fail the check, you gain 1 (or more, if specified) Corruption, along with the designated benefit. The \"Tempted\" state disappears, but naturally, you must now roll a fresh Concentration check since you just gained Corruption.\n\nWhen you are \"Tainted\", the DM can, at any time, attempt to force you to take actions. These actions can be anything, although they will generally serve the purposes of whatever planar source powers you--as opposed to being simply inconvenient or downright hostile to you and your allies. To resist, you must pass a Concentration check.\n- Complete success: you don't take the action, and instead act however you wish.\n- Mixed success: you don't take the action, but you lose your turn, or instead gain 1 Corruption.\n- Failure: you take the action.\n- In any case, after the roll and the subsequent action, your Corruption decreases by 1. If it falls below the threshold, you are no longer Tainted.\n\n\n# Relieving/Mitigating Corruption\n\nReduce Corruption you have gained is possible, but it takes time. Some of the most reliable ways are to purify yourself with an opposing energy (e.g. prayer or service to a good deity can remove the taint of Infernal power), or to coerce other mortals into service to your planar faction (e.g. tempting mortals to sin please the Infernal plane, rewarding you with reduced Corruption and therfore more agency to continue your great work).\n\nIn game terms, the above is a \"down time\" action that generally takes longer than a long rest and only fits into the time between episodes. Many adventurers need a quicker fix than that. There are a few other ways to rid yourself of Corruption, or indeed prevent it before it occurs:\n\n- Soul Shards: shards of mortal souls are the most valuable commodity in every non-prime plane, worth far more than gold or diamonds. Invokers can capture shards of mortal souls--or even souls entire--and place them into tradeable form. Although one cannot promise anything on behalf of another mortal, it is much easier for an outsider to parley with a mortal on their own terms, deep within their plane, then it is on the Prime Material. Thus, soul shards can pay off Corruption, or otherwise purchase Corruption-free power. This is generally not a morally justifiable decision, if you're concerned about that sort of thing.\n- Contract: by communing with representatives of your planar source, you can enter a contract where you perform some service, in exchange for relief of a given amount of Corruption.\n- Transfer: Corruption is a commodity. You accept it into your soul when you willingly choose to. Others can accept it from you, just as they could have accepted it from your planar source. Thus, you can arrange a transfer with any other Invoker, extraplanar creature, deity, or other suitably magical being with its own will, if you can otherwise get them to agree to it.\n\n\n\n# Bindings\n\nBindings do not cost feats or powers. When you accept a binding, you permanently gain its effect, and increase your minimum Corruption by the amount listed.\n\n**You can spend a feat to reduce Corruption cost of a given binding by 1.**\n\nName         | Corruption | Effect\n-------------|------------|-------\nArmor        | 1          | Gain a bonus to Armor equal to Cha + 1/2 level.

Capable of picking locks, opening/closing doors, operating switches, disarming traps, all using your own skills. Costs no Corruption if you devote your action to guiding them. Also:\n  - 1 Corruption: fairies steal a held item from target and deliver it to you or other location within range (Reflex negates)\n  - 2 Corruption: fairies remove all worn/held items from target, delivering them to location within range (Reflex negates each item)\n\n## Sensation\n- Glamour: you change your appearance at will, either disguising your identity, or decorating yourself to appear more comely.\n  - 0 corruption: change apparent identity to another member of same creature type and size (i.e. medium humanoid)\n  - 1 corruption: change type, or size within 1 category. Effect is illusionary (Will disbelieves, but otherwise damage is real and psychic)\n  - 1 corruption: targets not in combat are fascinated by you (Will ends, ends if they take damage or you attack)\n  - 1 corruption per target: appearance creates emotional effect, such as charm, unwillingness to harm you, belief you are in a position to give orders, etc. Will ends.\n- Magic Fingers: at-will, touch, 1 Corruption; you cause subject to experience any physical sensation you can imagine, within their mental capabilities. Generally, this causes subject to be stunned while active (Will ends).\n- Phantom Music: at-will, emanation; you produce music or otherwise musical sounds.\n  - 0 corruption: any mundane sound or music.\n  - 1 corruption: music or sound that inspires powerful emotions, such as:\n    - Courage: allies gain Fast Healing 10%, +50% movement, and advantage to loss-of-control effects.\n    - Intimidation: enemies suffer disadvantage to attack rolls (until one is successful), and must pass Will saves each time they are damaged by you or allies, lest they become frightened.\n    - more tbd\n\nIdeas:\n- Eyebite?\n\n\n## Wonder\n- Jubilation: burst of arcane power that can damage foes.

Compels Ebject to repent, or else causes mental ability damage, all while debilitating/disabling them.\n- Temptation: compels enemies to sin, potentially causing conflict among their ranks. Alternatively, grants allies a powerful buff, but they all gain Corruption. Examples:\n  - Avarice: maximize treasure die rolls, increase profit margins of buying/selling, add bonus treasure rolls, etc.\n  - Envy: gain an additional power or feat you could normally select, for the rest of the encounter.\n  - Pride: gain advantage to all checks for the encounter; lost as soon as you fail once.\n  - Sloth: instantly gain the benefit of a short rest.\n  - Wrath: bonus die of damage to all attacks for the encounter.\n\n## Suffering\n- Chains of Suffering: fiendish, barbed chains restrict enemy's movements, cause harm, deflect attacks, etc.\n- Curse of Agony: subject is wracked with pain, unable to take actions.

TBI\n- [Wall of Shadows](): At-will, std, wall 1/level, concentration; 20-ft high wall of total darkness blocks line of sight and line of effect for spells. Anything crossing it suffers medium necrotic damage.\n- [Shadow Double](): At-will, swift, ranged, concentration; you create a shadowy double of yourself or a chosen subject. The double is under your control, and has the same physical abilities as the subject.

TBI\n\n\n# Darkness\n- Absorb Light\n- Fear\n- Madness\n\n\n\n## Drain\n- [Drain Life](): at-will, std, ranged; medium necrotic damage, plus you heal yourself the same amount.

For every 5 levels of Invoker, gain +1 bonus drain and +1 die type (d3->d4->d6->etc).\n- [Drain Soul](): at-will, std, ranged; you extract a portion of the subject's soul, forming it into a glowing, black crystal called a Soul Shard. Subject suffers 1 level of enervation (-1 to all checks, disabled if enervation levels > hit dice). Choose one of the following:\n  - Fetish: you drain one of the subject's ability scores. They suffer a -4 penalty to that score while the soul shard exists, and you gain +4 to the same score. Lasts up to 24 hours.\n  - Phylactery: you use the soul fragment as the component for a phylactery (see [Create Phylactery]()).\n  - Steal Ability: you gain access to a single chosen power, maneuver, or skill that the subject possesses, while you retain the shard. Lasts up to 24 hours.\n\n\n# Void\n- [Star of the Void](): At-will, std, ranged; you summon a mote of pure void that annihilates anything it touches. Each round that you spend an action to control it, it moves as you desire, flying up to 10 squares and attacking one target (optionally). Target suffers heavy disintegration damage on contact (Reflex half). If you do not spend an action to control it, it acts however it wants (use the *Confusion* rules). To end the spell, you must spend an action to send it away. Anyone else with knowledge of this spell can contest your will for control of the Star.\n- [Disintegrate](): At-will, std, ranged; heavy disintegration damage (Fort half).\n- [Void Shield](): At-will, swift, concentration; you \"wield\" a disc of absolute blackness. As a reaction, you can absorb any incoming targeted effect. Spells and projectiles are annihilated on contact. Melee attackers can roll Reflex to pull back their attack; if they fail to do so, their weapon is annihilated. Unarmed attackers get a similar save to avoid heavy disintegration damage. Magic items get a Willpower save to avoid destruction. This spell is probably OP.\n- [Hungering Void](): At-will, std, ranged, 1 square; you tear open a hole in reality, sucking everything toward it, and ejecting whatever falls into it into deepest night. This spell is super OP and I have to figure out how to balance it.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Feats\nEach time you select one of the below feats, you also gain:\n- +1 HP/level\n- +1 Spellcraft, Concentration, Willpower\n- +0.5 Fortitude, Reflex\n\n\n\n\n# Spell Enhancements\n- Mirror Image: modifies *Veil*.\n- Rainbow Beam: modifies *Color Spray*.

On sacrifice, dispel all instances of a spell in a burst 2.\n  - Death sprite: light necrotic damage plus Resist 50% (healing) for 3 rds.\n\n\n# Bladebound\n- Bound Arms: at-will, swift; you \"summon\" one of your minions, but rather than giving them an independent form, you bind them into the shape of a weapon, or into the form of an existing weapon. In the former case, the weapon's stats are equal to a normal martial weapon you are proficient with.\n  - Imp: adds medium fire damage, plus light fire ongoing for 3 rds.\n  - Pixie: can put enemies to sleep, or adds +10 critical threat range.\n  - Succubus: adds medium necrotic damage, can entangle and wrack.\n- Fusion: at-will, swift; you \"summon\" one of your minions, but rather than giving them an independent form, you bind them into the shape of armor, or into the form of your existing armor. In the former case, the armor's stats are equal to a normal armor type you are proficient with. Examples:\n  - Voidwalker: Absorb 50% (any), limit medium damage each round. Resist shadow/necrotic.\n  - etc\n- Armiger: summon a bunch of weapons at once, costs Corruption, etc.\n\n\n# Summoner\n- Rapid Summons: your minion-summoning spells with a standard action are now swift actions; those that were already swift are free (once/rd).\n- Soul Link: when a minion is within range, half the damage you suffer is transferred to them. Any death or loss-of-control effect you suffer has a 50% chance of transferring to the minion.\n- Sacrifice: at-will, reaction; you sacrifice an active minion, expending them as if they reached 0 HP, but producing a powerful effect:\n  - Imp: close burst 5, heavy fire damage plus half ongoing for 3 rds.\n  - Succubus: TBD\n  - Pixie: close burst 5, allies can choose to teleport anywhere in range that they can see, and they become invisible until they attack or take damage (or until 1 hour passes).\n  - Felhunter: close burst 5, dispel attempt against a chosen effect on each target, or dispel attempt against each effect on one target. Allies gain Resist 50% (magic) for 2 rounds.\n  - Voidwalker: close burst 5, allies gain Absorb 100% (all, limit Voidwalker's max HP).\n  - Sprite: close burst 2, same effect as a normal attack, but double damagee.\n- Evolution: advances your minion to a more powerful form. Examples:\n  - Void Knight: has Pound, Gravity, Shadowy Shield.\n  - Ethereal: more powerful shade that has enhanced abilities while ethereal.\n  - Sylph: pixie that can heal you, put enemies to sleep, aura grants allies bonus movement.\n  - Dread Stalker: more deadly felhunter. Has cool dredlocks. Has Phase Shift, Shadow Tunnel, grants allies magic detection.\n- Minion Resilience: your Minions gain 2 HP/level.\n- Share Senses: you gain your minions' extra senses.\n\n\n\n# Minions\n\nPowers such as [Summon Pixie]() grants you the listed minion as a permanent ally.\n\nAlthough each minion has a \"canonical\" flavor (e.g. Pixie is Fey, Imp is Infernal), all Invokers can select any minions they choose, and re-flavor as desired. A fey invoker might summon a \"redcap\" with Imp stats, or a Shadow invoker could summon a \"shadow stalker\" with Felhunter stats, for example.\n\nNotes on summoning:\n- You can only control one summoned minion at a time (summoned via an Invoker spell with \"summon\" in the title). The exception is Summon Sprites, which does not apply to the limit, nor do other summons apply to that spell's limit.\n- Invokers who use Willpower can attempt to control multiple minions at a time. Whenever the number of minions changes, and that number is higher than 1, roll Willpower opposed to Cha save for each minion; on success, they are controlled, and on failure, they run wild.\n- Minions have their own HP and Mana pools. When they reach 0 HP, they are immediately unsummoned, and cannot be summoned again for 24 hours, after which they are restored to 100% HP and Mana.\n- Minions can take a long rest, either in the prime material plane or when away from you.\n\n\n\n# Pixie\n- Ability scores: her Dex and Cha = your Int/Wis/Cha (whichever is highest), others are 0\n- Saves: Dex, Cha\n- Size: tiny\n- Movement: fly 6\n- AC: 10 + Dex\n- HP: 1 per level\n- Mana: 1 per level\n- Attacks:\n  - Needle: std, melee, Dex vs AC; light arcane damage.\n- Special:\n  - Sneak Attack: against unaware targets, inflict critical damage.\n  - Invisibility: swift, recharge 33%; pixie becomes invisible until she attacks or takes damage.\n  - Legerdemain: she is proficient in Acrobatics, Stealth, and Sleight of Hand\n  - Sleep: can put a single target to sleep on successful sneak attack if they are unaware.\n  - Pixie Dust: can cause a single target to laugh or sneeze uncontrollably (Con ends), or similar usage of dust (e.g. drug trips).\n\n## Evolution: Sylph\n- +2 HP/level\n- Healing Dust: recharge 33%, swift, touch; heals subject for medium damage.\n- Think Happy Thoughts: emanation 10; allies gain a fly speed equal to walking speed.\n- Arcane Arrow: at-will, std; medium arcane damage, 20/x3.\n- Improved Invisibility: Invisibility becomes at-will.\n\n\n# Felhunter\n- Ability scores: Str and Con = your Int/Wis/Cha (whichever is highest), Dex and Wis are half that, Int and Cha 0\n- Saves: Str, Con\n- Size: medium\n- Movement: walk 6\n- AC: 10 + Dex + proficiency bonus\n- HP: 2 per level\n- Attacks:\n  - Bite: std, melee, Str vs AC; light piercing damage, plus one special:\n    - Spell Lock: next spell subject casts, they must pass a Concentration check against the damage of the bite in order not to lose the spell.

One humanoid that the shade can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the shade; the shade then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The shade now controls the body but doesn’t deprive the target of awareness. The shade can’t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target’s statistics, but doesn’t gain access to the target’s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the shade ends it as a bonus action, or the shade is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the shade reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this shade’s Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.\n- Special:\n  - Ethereal Sight.

While this arrangement is not unheard of, it rarely results in a long and lucrative career for the Invoker. Anybody can sell their soul--that doesn't make them a Invoker. Instead, the wise Invoker follows the Principle of Equal Exchange, the fundamental law of the Pact. In essence, all Outsiders, regardless of outward appearance or presumed morality, are supernaturally bound to honor contracts and deals, and when a debt is repaid, it is repaid. The devil is, of course, in the details, and thus the true measure of a successful Invoker is whether they can harness the power of Outsiders without becoming hopelessly entrapped by them.</p>\n<p>Of course, it is hardly uncommon for a Invoker not to have some sort of debt or kinship he can't easily rid himself of, and this is handled separately. As a rule, Invoker spells and rituals are self-balancing and do not imply permanent debt, while [[#Corruption]] results when a Invoker, wittingly or otherwise, permanently exchanges some sort of debt or bondage in exchange for power.</p>\n<h1>Basic Abilities</h1>\n<!--\nAttribute     | Value\n---------     | -----\nHit Die       | d8\nHP/level      | 5\nWeapon Prof.  | None\nArmor Prof.   | None\nSaving Throws | Int, Cha\n-->\n<p>Brief version:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your primary limiting factor is Corruption, an attribute describing how much your planar powers have corrupted your soul.

At any time, the DM can attempt to compel you into an action you might not have otherwise willed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When &quot;Tempted&quot;, the DM can, at an opportune time, offer you a deal on behalf of the planar forces from which you gain power. This must be at a time when your character would be reasonably willing to borrow power for some worthwhile gain. The deal is generally the same as any other action you might have taken: for a given Corruption cost, you gain a certain effect. However, the power can be something you couldn't normally access, or have a powerful enhancement such as using it while you are incapacitated, or as an immediate action, or having empowered effect. In any case, you must pass a Concentration check to resist (you can voluntarily fail if you choose). If you fail the check, you gain 1 (or more, if specified) Corruption, along with the designated benefit. The &quot;Tempted&quot; state disappears, but naturally, you must now roll a fresh Concentration check since you just gained Corruption.</p>\n<p>When you are &quot;Tainted&quot;, the DM can, at any time, attempt to force you to take actions. These actions can be anything, although they will generally serve the purposes of whatever planar source powers you--as opposed to being simply inconvenient or downright hostile to you and your allies. To resist, you must pass a Concentration check.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete success: you don't take the action, and instead act however you wish.</li>\n<li>Mixed success: you don't take the action, but you lose your turn, or instead gain 1 Corruption.</li>\n<li>Failure: you take the action.</li>\n<li>In any case, after the roll and the subsequent action, your Corruption decreases by 1. If it falls below the threshold, you are no longer Tainted.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Relieving/Mitigating Corruption</h1>\n<p>Reduce Corruption you have gained is possible, but it takes time. Some of the most reliable ways are to purify yourself with an opposing energy (e.g. prayer or service to a good deity can remove the taint of Infernal power), or to coerce other mortals into service to your planar faction (e.g. tempting mortals to sin please the Infernal plane, rewarding you with reduced Corruption and therfore more agency to continue your great work).</p>\n<p>In game terms, the above is a &quot;down time&quot; action that generally takes longer than a long rest and only fits into the time between episodes. Many adventurers need a quicker fix than that. There are a few other ways to rid yourself of Corruption, or indeed prevent it before it occurs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Soul Shards: shards of mortal souls are the most valuable commodity in every non-prime plane, worth far more than gold or diamonds. Invokers can capture shards of mortal souls--or even souls entire--and place them into tradeable form. Although one cannot promise anything on behalf of another mortal, it is much easier for an outsider to parley with a mortal on their own terms, deep within their plane, then it is on the Prime Material. Thus, soul shards can pay off Corruption, or otherwise purchase Corruption-free power. This is generally not a morally justifiable decision, if you're concerned about that sort of thing.</li>\n<li>Contract: by communing with representatives of your planar source, you can enter a contract where you perform some service, in exchange for relief of a given amount of Corruption.</li>\n<li>Transfer: Corruption is a commodity. You accept it into your soul when you willingly choose to. Others can accept it from you, just as they could have accepted it from your planar source. Thus, you can arrange a transfer with any other Invoker, extraplanar creature, deity, or other suitably magical being with its own will, if you can otherwise get them to agree to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Bindings</h1>\n<p>Bindings do not cost feats or powers. When you accept a binding, you permanently gain its effect, and increase your minimum Corruption by the amount listed.</p>\n<p><strong>You can spend a feat to reduce Corruption cost of a given binding by 1.</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Corruption</th>\n<th>Effect</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Armor</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Gain a bonus to Armor equal to Cha + 1/2 level.

Subject suffers 1 level of enervation (-1 to all checks, disabled if enervation levels &gt; hit dice). Choose one of the following:\n<ul>\n<li>Fetish: you drain one of the subject's ability scores. They suffer a -4 penalty to that score while the soul shard exists, and you gain +4 to the same score.

Each round that you spend an action to control it, it moves as you desire, flying up to 10 squares and attacking one target (optionally). Target suffers heavy disintegration damage on contact (Reflex half). If you do not spend an action to control it, it acts however it wants (use the <em>Confusion</em> rules).

Magic items get a Willpower save to avoid destruction. This spell is probably OP.</li>\n<li><a href=\"\">Hungering Void</a>: At-will, std, ranged, 1 square; you tear open a hole in reality, sucking everything toward it, and ejecting whatever falls into it into deepest night.

Any death or loss-of-control effect you suffer has a 50% chance of transferring to the minion.</li>\n<li>Sacrifice: at-will, reaction; you sacrifice an active minion, expending them as if they reached 0 HP, but producing a powerful effect:\n<ul>\n<li>Imp: close burst 5, heavy fire damage plus half ongoing for 3 rds.</li>\n<li>Succubus: TBD</li>\n<li>Pixie: close burst 5, allies can choose to teleport anywhere in range that they can see, and they become invisible until they attack or take damage (or until 1 hour passes).</li>\n<li>Felhunter: close burst 5, dispel attempt against a chosen effect on each target, or dispel attempt against each effect on one target.

A female spellcaster? \n\nAbsolutely not.\n\nThaumaturgy is one of the fundamental arts of spellcasting. It is the study and practice of the Law of Sympathy: as above, so below, as without, so within, etc. Parts of a whole have what is called a \"sympathetic link\" to the whole. This enables such magic as a phylactery: a totem created with a small sample of a creature which can be used to locate them or bind magic to them. All spellcasters use thaumaturgy to some degree.\n\nWitchcraft is the deep study and mastery of both thaumaturgy, and of the fundamental revelation that All is Connected: sympathetic bonds tie together all of the cosmos. No action or individual exists in isolation, and therefore no working of magic goes without consequence. Witches understand their place within the grand cosmic working of magic--a profound and awesome experience, but a humbling one as well. They realize that every spell they casts has an equivalent reaction--it may not immediately rebound upon them, but it will, in its course, take its toll. And thus, they understand that all harmful magic--all of it, always--returns the ill will of the caster back onto herself, in some way, at some point.\n\nThis, understandably, has a dramatic impact on the way witches work magic, as compared to others who do not or cannot see this connection.\n\nThe study of a magical working's \"intent\"--i.e. for good, ill, or neutral--is called its Chroma. Likened to a spectrum of colors, Chroma reflects the nuance of nature--it is hardly black and white, so labels such as \"black magic\" and \"white magic\" are laughable to true students of witchcraft. A thorough understanding of Chroma allows witches to work magic to their advantage without accumulating too many negative consequences.\n\n\n# Basic Abilities\n\nBrief version:\n- Your primary limiting factor is Vitae, which is simply a quantification of life energy. You have some within you, as do all living creatures. Your own is handy for use, but obviously quite precious and shouldn't be expended too much. You can use the Vitae of others, or existing within the natural world--it works just as well to empower your spells.\n- Your secondary limiting factor is Chroma, a measure of the moral intent of spellcasting. Harmful magic tends to rebound upon you in time, while helpful magic reduces that effect.\n- Things you can learn with talents:\n  - Spells: pretty obvious what these are.\n  - Bindings: permanent or at-will magical abilities that generally don't cost Vitae to use, but rather reduce the Vitae you have available to power other spells.\n  - Felicity: reflections of the harmony you share with the essence of magic.\n  - Name TBD: invocations of Chroma itself.\n\n\n# Core skills\n\n# Old section, plz ignore\n- You use Spellcraft (Int) to cast spells.\n- You use Concentration (Wis) to sustain your spells and Perception (Wis) to perceive and understand the workings of Chroma.\n- You use Willpower (Cha) to try to work Chroma to your will. Your Charisma also factors into your Felicity powers.\n\n# Thaumaturgy\n\n## Clarity\n\nYou perceive the flow of magic.\n- Rank 1: detect magical auras on sight, spend a swift action to analyze one (Spellcraft check) to learn its power level, school, and approximate purpose.\n- Rank 2: detect magical auras regardless of concealment, instantly detect level, school, and sphere. etc\n\n\n## Ritual Spells\n\n### Rank 1\n- Command Undead: At-will, swift, short range; you dominate targeted undead creature (Will ends, 3 strike rule, 10% penalty per failure). May slot reserve to bind until sunrise.\n  - Reversed: At-will, swift, short range; you release targeted undead creature from the domination of another. Subject is allowed 3 Will saves to end domination, only 1 success if needed. If all 3 fail, subject cannot be freed by this ritual until after sunrise.\n- Death Sight: At-will, concentration; you see through the eyes of an undead minion under your control, and establish a telepathic link through which you may command it; max range 1 mile/level.\n  - Reversed: Recharge 33%, swift, medium range; subject undead is blinded (Fort ends).\n- Evoke Flame: Free, medium range; targeted blood, freshly spilled within last 3 rounds, burst into flames, providing heat and light and igniting flammable objects as normal. Blood burns as long as you remain in long range, or until the sun rises.\n  - Reversed: Free; you suffer medium physical damage, letting your blood flow, which you then cast in a short cone. Any fires in the area, natural or otherwise, are immediately quenched.\n- Create Phylactery: 10 minutes, reagent cost (1 sp plus a sympathetic component); you create a - phylactery: being an object that uses sympathetic magic to create a thaumaturgical connection to another creature. The key ingredient is a sympathetic component, such as blood, hair, or even a prized possession. The object's composition does not matter much; usually, it is a simple doll. The phylactery allows the following uses:\n  - Locate Creature: at-will; as you concentrate, you sense the direction of the creature, and the rough distance (1 yard, 10 yards, 100 yards, 1 mile, 10 miles, 100 miles, etc).\n  - Spirit Link: at-will; you create a mental link to the creature. You may speak to the subject through that creature. You perceive the subject and its most immediate surroundings (a few feet). Lasts as long as you concentrate.\n  - Transmit Weal or Woe: at-will; you may cast a spell or use a physical attack against the doll. This transmits the effect of the spell or attack to the subject, over any distance, bypassing all wards. Each such attack has a 25% chance of destroying the doll permanently.\n  - Recall Spirit: 1 minute cast, concentration, subject must be dead; you conjure the creature's spirit, allowing communication. If unwilling to cooperate, you may force the subject spirit to answer questions (Will ends effect, one save per question). Destroys phylactery.\n  - Steal Visage: 1 minute cast, reserve; you take the form of subject, down to the most minute detail. You know important knowledge the subject would know, such as the names and faces of his close companions. To recall an important detail, such as a secret only he would know, when prompted for it, you may force it from the phylactery (Will ends; a passed save means you can conjure no more secrets this casting). Destroys phylactery.\n\n### Rank 2\n- Death and Rebirth: 10 minutes, reagent (1 living creature of the same type as the subject, e.g. \"natural humanoid\"); you sacrifice a living creature, and use its passing to resurrect a subject who has been dead for up to 1 day/level.\nReversed: Dead subject quickly decays into dust; in a radius around the subject, verdant life springs forth from the ground, in full bloom. Radius is based on the level of subject (10 yards for minor creatures, otherwise 100 yards per level). Optionally, subject's bones remain.\n\n### Rank 3\n- Create Hearthstone: 10 minutes, reagent (a stone from the destination hearth, plus 10 gp); you create a stone which allows you to teleport to the destination hearth. A hearthstone has a 1 hour cooldown.\n  - Reversed: 10 minutes, reagent (one hearthstone); you destroy the hearthstone, and the hearth to which it is meant to teleport its user, negating the function of any other hearthstones connected to it.\n- Create Greater Phylactery: 1 hour, reagent cost (1 gp plus a strong sympathetic component); as Create Phylactery, but requires the strongest of sympathetic components, such as a vial of fresh blood (no more than 5 minutes exposed at start of ritual) or a portion of subject's soul. Allows all uses of a standard phylactery, plus:\n  - Transmit Weal or Woe: same as normal, except phylactery can suffer 5 \"hits\" before being destroyed.\n  - Steal Visage: same as normal, but does not destroy phylactery.\n  - Steal Spell: at-will; you may cast a spell that the subject knows, as if you knew it.\nMagnify Harm: constant; any harm you inflict upon subject directly (not through Transmit Weal or Woe) is increased in effectiveness by 50%.\n  - Domination: at-will, concentration; you may control subject's actions (Contest of Wills).\n\n\n\n# Spells\n\n\n\n# Bindings\n\n\n# Felicity\nThe path of the Witch is challenging. Upon realization of the reality of Chroma, a witch realizes she is more limited than other casters--or rather, she is simply aware of limitations they too possess, but are too naive to notice. This somewhat reduces the outright usefulness of magic, especially to an adventurer, who might, for intance, find frequent need for harmful magic.\n\nThere is an advantage to this inconvenient knowledge. By understanding magic on a more fundamental level, witches find themselves in greater harmony with magic than other practitioners. The Felicity talents express this ability, granting advantages that reflect how magic itself tends to favor you, sometimes more so than its wielder.\n\nSome of these talents reserve Vitae, and some have Chroma requirements. Some have no requirements.\n\n- Absorb Magic: Reaction to incoming magic within melee range; you intercept the magic with your left hand, attempting to absorb its power. Roll Fortitude against the spell's DC. On success, you gain Vitae equal to the spell's effect, and nullify its intended effect. On mixed success, choose one. On failure, you gain no Vitae and suffer the effect.\n  - Spellsteal: At-will, std, melee range; you use a variant of Absorb Magic on a spellcaster or active spell, \"stealing\" it. Roll Spellcraft vs DC; on success, you nullify the effect or steal an appropriate amount of magical energy from a caster, and gain a single, consumable use of that power (which requires whatever action would be normal to cast it). Can also target magic items, draining their power and effectiveness.\n- Clarity: At will, you can detect magical auras, discerning the identity and purpose of all effects that you are of sufficient level to have cast (even if not from the Witch list).\n  - True Seeing: You can see the true form of any creature whose is obscured by magical or mundane means, even if invisible.\n  - Arcane Sight: You know what spells and magical abilities a creature is capable of casting, if they are visible to you.\n- Ecstasy: Every time you work magic, you experience the bliss and divinity of the cosmos. In practical terms, this allows you to gain a benefit for each spell cast: heal yourself for light damage, remove a toxin or harmful magical effect from yourself (Spellcraft vs DC), or automatically remove any fear or negative emotion effect from yourself.\n- Friend of Magic: All magic that distinguishes between friend or foe (e.g. it says \"enemies suffer xyz or allies gain xyz\") has a 5% chance per level (minimum 25%) to treat you as whichever is more advantageous, regardless of caster's intent. All other hostile magic has a 1% chance per level (no minimum) to have no effect on you.\n\n\n\n\n# Powers\n\n# Pestilence\n\n1 action, touch or 60-ft, V/S, inst; you infect subject with a chosen disease. Diseases last 5 rounds; each application of the same disease refreshes the duration.\n- '''Blood Boil''': subject suffers light fire damage per round, and when struck for physical damage, causes a burst 1 inflicting light fire damage to enemies.\n- '''Frost Fever''': subject suffers light cold damage per round, and is *chilled* (Fort ends).\n- '''Shadow Plague''': subject suffers light necrotic damage per round, and is Weakened (half damage).\n\nMetamagic options:\n- For +1 mana, add an additional disease at casting time.\n- For +1 mana, you can modify the spell so that it spreads diseases from one target onto others within 2 squares (+1 mana to add +2 squares).\n\n# Transfusion\n\nSwift, touch; you transfer any amount of damage from subject to yourself, to a limit of the amount that would reduce you to 0 HP.\n\nReversed:\n\nStd, touch; you steal subject's life, transferring your damage to them, to a limit of the amount that would fully heal you, or the amount that would reduce them to 0, or heavy damage: whichever is lowest. They are allowed a Fort save for half damage.\n\n# Burning Blood\n\nWhen you have suffered damage, you can call upon the power of your own blood to deliver vengeance upon your enemies.\n\nStd, ranged; inflicts fire damage equal to the amount of damage you have suffered.\n- For +1 mana, change to cone 3, or add +3 squares to cone.\n- For +1 mana, change to burst 2, or add +2 squares to burst.\n\nFeat ideas:\n- Feat that lets you use someone else's blood (maybe not specific to this power)\n\n# Blood Calls to Blood\n\nEncounter, swift, medium range; you control subject's physical actions (Will ends). Requires subject's blood; any time a creature suffers physical damage, it spills blood upon the creature, the weapon, and the ground nearby.\n\n# Blood Rage\n\nRequires your own blood; grants scaling bonuses to damage and haste based on how damaged you are. You can let your own blood to make this happen. Rules TBD.\n\n# Ironguard\n\nYou become immune to iron-based weapons. They may as well be incorporeal. Rules TBD\n\n# Frozen Blood\n\nYou suffer no debilitation from being at or below 0 HP: no disabled, no dying, and no death. That is, until the spell ends.\n\n# Presence\n\nEvoke an emotional state in others in an emanation. Can buff or debuff. Rules TBD\n\n# Phantasm\n\nStd, ranged; you control what subject senses while you concentrate (Cha ends, but only if they realize the effect is happening; you can use Deception to fool them if your phantasm is suitably subtle).\n\n# Emotion\n\nEmotion: Single action, ranged; subject is affected by a single, powerful emotion. Choose one of the following\nCalm: Subject immediately ceases all action and contemplates life. Wisdom save ends; any hostility against target ends the effect. Can also use on an ally to nullify a negative emotion effect or berserker rage.\nDesire: Subject is overcome with desire for caster or another of caster's choice, undermining his judgment. Rules TBD.\nFear: Subject becomes frightened, ceasing all action but to flee and defend himself. Wisdom save ends after first round.\nResolve: Subject's will is hardened; he gains advantage to all saving throws for 1 minute.\nRage: Subject immediately becomes hostile to everyone. Wisdom save ends.\n\n# Mind Control\n\nMind Control: Single action, concentration, long range; you control subject's actions while he remains within Long range (Wisdom save ends, max one save per 10 minutes). Any hostile actions by your allies against subject negates the spell.\n\n## Soulgaze\n\n+ Soul Splint\n\n## Reanimate\n\nReanimate: 1 action, 60-ft, V/S, 5 rounds#### you animate one or more recently-dead (within the last hour) corpses (of humanoids or animals). The cost is one Mana per creature animated. You may control a maximum of 1 + 1 per 2 levels as a bonus action (60-ft range, language-dependent); any others act on your last command, or, lacking such command, act as crazed, starved, wild animals might. The traits of the animated dead are\n'''Undead:''' immune to death effects, energy drain, etc. Cannot be healed as living creatures would. Vulnerable to abilities that affect undead specifically.\n'''Clumsy:''' -2 to Dex and movement speed.\n'''Stupid:''' Int set to 5. They are barely able to understand the simplest of spoken commands, with the aid of gestures and nonverbal communication. They lose any spellcasting abilities, skills, feats, class features, and proficiencies. If wielding martial weapons, they are disadvantaged on attack rolls (but are fine with simple weapons).\n'''Doomed:''' At the end of the duration of the spell, they die once more, and cannot be raised again with Reanimate.\n\n## Necrosis\n\nNecrosis: Single action, medium range; part of subject's body dies, then grows into a new limb, head, or whatever is needed, which wields the subject's own strength against it and its allies. Each round, for 3 rounds, you may choose one of the subject's own maneuvers or spells and execute it, with the subject's own damage statistics.\n\n\n## Frost Block\n\n- 1 mana, std, ranged; subject is immobile, unable to act, and invulnerable, as all attacks strike the frost block first. The block has HP equal to a heavy damage roll. It is immune to frost damage and vulnerable to fire damage. On turn start, the creature inside, if warm-blooded, suffers light frost damage and reduces the ice block's HP by the same amount. They can, as a standard action, attempt to burst free by passing a Strength check against the spell's DC; on success, they inflict medium kinetic damage to the ice block.\n  - +1 Mana: +100% ice block HP\n  - +1 Mana: change cast time to reaction, target to self. Can end the effect as a free action.\n\n  ","bodyHtml":"<h1>Witch</h1>\n<p>What is a witch?

Can also target magic items, draining their power and effectiveness.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Clarity: At will, you can detect magical auras, discerning the identity and purpose of all effects that you are of sufficient level to have cast (even if not from the Witch list).\n<ul>\n<li>True Seeing: You can see the true form of any creature whose is obscured by magical or mundane means, even if invisible.</li>\n<li>Arcane Sight: You know what spells and magical abilities a creature is capable of casting, if they are visible to you.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ecstasy: Every time you work magic, you experience the bliss and divinity of the cosmos. In practical terms, this allows you to gain a benefit for each spell cast: heal yourself for light damage, remove a toxin or harmful magical effect from yourself (Spellcraft vs DC), or automatically remove any fear or negative emotion effect from yourself.</li>\n<li>Friend of Magic: All magic that distinguishes between friend or foe (e.g. it says &quot;enemies suffer xyz or allies gain xyz&quot;) has a 5% chance per level (minimum 25%) to treat you as whichever is more advantageous, regardless of caster's intent. All other hostile magic has a 1% chance per level (no minimum) to have no effect on you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Powers</h1>\n<h1>Pestilence</h1>\n<p>1 action, touch or 60-ft, V/S, inst; you infect subject with a chosen disease. Diseases last 5 rounds; each application of the same disease refreshes the duration.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>'''Blood Boil''': subject suffers light fire damage per round, and when struck for physical damage, causes a burst 1 inflicting light fire damage to enemies.</li>\n<li>'''Frost Fever''': subject suffers light cold damage per round, and is <em>chilled</em> (Fort ends).</li>\n<li>'''Shadow Plague''': subject suffers light necrotic damage per round, and is Weakened (half damage).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Metamagic options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For +1 mana, add an additional disease at casting time.</li>\n<li>For +1 mana, you can modify the spell so that it spreads diseases from one target onto others within 2 squares (+1 mana to add +2 squares).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Transfusion</h1>\n<p>Swift, touch; you transfer any amount of damage from subject to yourself, to a limit of the amount that would reduce you to 0 HP.</p>\n<p>Reversed:</p>\n<p>Std, touch; you steal subject's life, transferring your damage to them, to a limit of the amount that would fully heal you, or the amount that would reduce them to 0, or heavy damage: whichever is lowest. They are allowed a Fort save for half damage.</p>\n<h1>Burning Blood</h1>\n<p>When you have suffered damage, you can call upon the power of your own blood to deliver vengeance upon your enemies.</p>\n<p>Std, ranged; inflicts fire damage equal to the amount of damage you have suffered.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For +1 mana, change to cone 3, or add +3 squares to cone.</li>\n<li>For +1 mana, change to burst 2, or add +2 squares to burst.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Feat ideas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Feat that lets you use someone else's blood (maybe not specific to this power)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Blood Calls to Blood</h1>\n<p>Encounter, swift, medium range; you control subject's physical actions (Will ends). Requires subject's blood; any time a creature suffers physical damage, it spills blood upon the creature, the weapon, and the ground nearby.</p>\n<h1>Blood Rage</h1>\n<p>Requires your own blood; grants scaling bonuses to damage and haste based on how damaged you are. You can let your own blood to make this happen. Rules TBD.</p>\n<h1>Ironguard</h1>\n<p>You become immune to iron-based weapons. They may as well be incorporeal. Rules TBD</p>\n<h1>Frozen Blood</h1>\n<p>You suffer no debilitation from being at or below 0 HP: no disabled, no dying, and no death. That is, until the spell ends.</p>\n<h1>Presence</h1>\n<p>Evoke an emotional state in others in an emanation. Can buff or debuff. Rules TBD</p>\n<h1>Phantasm</h1>\n<p>Std, ranged; you control what subject senses while you concentrate (Cha ends, but only if they realize the effect is happening; you can use Deception to fool them if your phantasm is suitably subtle).</p>\n<h1>Emotion</h1>\n<p>Emotion: Single action, ranged; subject is affected by a single, powerful emotion. Choose one of the following\nCalm: Subject immediately ceases all action and contemplates life. Wisdom save ends; any hostility against target ends the effect. Can also use on an ally to nullify a negative emotion effect or berserker rage.\nDesire: Subject is overcome with desire for caster or another of caster's choice, undermining his judgment. Rules TBD.\nFear: Subject becomes frightened, ceasing all action but to flee and defend himself. Wisdom save ends after first round.\nResolve: Subject's will is hardened; he gains advantage to all saving throws for 1 minute.\nRage: Subject immediately becomes hostile to everyone. Wisdom save ends.</p>\n<h1>Mind Control</h1>\n<p>Mind Control: Single action, concentration, long range; you control subject's actions while he remains within Long range (Wisdom save ends, max one save per 10 minutes). Any hostile actions by your allies against subject negates the spell.</p>\n<h2>Soulgaze</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Soul Splint</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Reanimate</h2>\n<p>Reanimate: 1 action, 60-ft, V/S, 5 rounds#### you animate one or more recently-dead (within the last hour) corpses (of humanoids or animals). The cost is one Mana per creature animated. You may control a maximum of 1 + 1 per 2 levels as a bonus action (60-ft range, language-dependent); any others act on your last command, or, lacking such command, act as crazed, starved, wild animals might. The traits of the animated dead are\n'''Undead:''' immune to death effects, energy drain, etc. Cannot be healed as living creatures would. Vulnerable to abilities that affect undead specifically.\n'''Clumsy:''' -2 to Dex and movement speed.\n'''Stupid:''' Int set to 5. They are barely able to understand the simplest of spoken commands, with the aid of gestures and nonverbal communication. They lose any spellcasting abilities, skills, feats, class features, and proficiencies. If wielding martial weapons, they are disadvantaged on attack rolls (but are fine with simple weapons).\n'''Doomed:''' At the end of the duration of the spell, they die once more, and cannot be raised again with Reanimate.</p>\n<h2>Necrosis</h2>\n<p>Necrosis: Single action, medium range; part of subject's body dies, then grows into a new limb, head, or whatever is needed, which wields the subject's own strength against it and its allies. Each round, for 3 rounds, you may choose one of the subject's own maneuvers or spells and execute it, with the subject's own damage statistics.</p>\n<h2>Frost Block</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>1 mana, std, ranged; subject is immobile, unable to act, and invulnerable, as all attacks strike the frost block first. The block has HP equal to a heavy damage roll. It is immune to frost damage and vulnerable to fire damage. On turn start, the creature inside, if warm-blooded, suffers light frost damage and reduces the ice block's HP by the same amount. They can, as a standard action, attempt to burst free by passing a Strength check against the spell's DC; on success, they inflict medium kinetic damage to the ice block.\n<ul>\n<li>+1 Mana: +100% ice block HP</li>\n<li>+1 Mana: change cast time to reaction, target to self. Can end the effect as a free action.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n","metadata":null,"transformedMetadata":"default transform"},{"name":"index","contents":"Powers are abilities that are supernatural or extraordinary in nature that make you...well, more powerful.\r\n\r\nSpells are an obvious type of power, but there are others, such as passive or constant effects, supernatural objects or gear, or even the effect of your legacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nMechanically, powers are simple: you gain 1 per level, plus 1 at character creation (i.e. level \"0\").

Candidates include:\n\n- 5e style (every check is stat + optional proficiency; may have multiple levels of proficiency)\n- actual classes (hybrids?)\n\n\n# Core magical abilities\n\nWhither rituals? And *detect magic*? All the stuff practitioners should have, but aren't about to sink an entire power on it? How do they get these abilities?\n\nConsidering the archetypal characters, there seems to be a three-way tradeoff. That is, you have a given amount to invest into three categories:\n- Pure caster\n- Monster/enhanced\n- Exceptional fighter/rogue/etc\n\nBut it's not quite so simple. System 8 explicitly doesn't let you trade away powers; you don't have to have spell-like abilities, but you have to have something: super strength, uncanny luck, even if it's not from your blood, but from a cool item or something. It's essential to maintain some sort of balance.\n\nThis would seem to imply that there are really only two \"classes\" per se:\n- Pure Caster\n- Innate Power (monster, enhanced, cool item, etc)\n\nSo who is good at fighting? Well, melee attacks or whatever aren't really on this spectrum. Whatever normal HP, ACs, attack and damage rolls, etc that a level X caster can achieve, a level X innate can use their power to easily overmatch them. Training should matter, too, of course, but it seems like the job is mostly taken care of by ability scores. The true \"glass cannon\" style of pure caster will entirely neglect their physical stats and be rubbish at physical combat, whereas an innate power user should have little use for most of the mental stats and will necessarily have more focus in the physical ones (if not more ability score points overall due to said innate power).\n\nThis doesn't suit a 3.5 base very well. Two classes isn't a great look for d20, especially since neither fits any of the in-between abilities like Reflex. It might work with a 5e base somewhat better, where we just let people pick their ability scores as normal, and let proficiency separate the level bands. Maybe we can borrow something from PF2 and have different levels of proficiency (proficient, expert, etc).\n\nSo what does this look like? Let's talk specifics.\n\n\n# The \"Classes\"\n\nThere are really only two, but we'll pretend there are more by shifting the label of \"class\" down to the level of subclass. Thus:\n- Practitioners\n  - Invoker\n  - Elementalist\n  - Thaumaturge\n  - Arcanist\n  - Psion\n- Monsters\n  - Vampire\n  - Elemental\n  - Undead\n  - Sylvan\n  - etc\n- Innate\n\n\nFuck, no. It doesn't work. What if you're an innate power user who uses Invocation bindings? Why have separate classes for Elemental and Elementalist?\n\nWell, the other approach would seem to be:\n\n# Classes and Powers\n\nClasses describe training, skills, experience, hard work, knowledge, etc. Powers are cool supernatural things you can do. They are separate game mechanics.\n\nA power is something like \"Fireball\". Maybe you can make a fireball because you're a wizard who has studied magic for years and knows the arcane symbols and words to evoke one. Maybe you can do so because you're a sorcerer and fire is in your blood; you don't have to think about it, magic just comes out. Maybe you can do so because you're literally a fire elemental, and making a fireball is as natural for you as throwing a punch is for a human. Either way, it's a 20-ft radius burst that does medium fire damage, and costs 1 power slot on your character sheet.\n\nBut that other stuff? The difference between erudite wizards, innate sorcerers, and monsters? That's what classes are for.\n\nClasses, and some of the abilities they grant:\n\n\n## Practitioner\n\nThe classic \"pure caster\". Count on high mana, the ability to detect magic, dispel, counterspell, metamagic, feats to modify and augment your powers, creating items to enhance spellcasting, etc.\n\nFocuses on the three mental ability scores:\n- Int is useful for crafting spells, making up new modifiers for a spell on the fly, identifying and countering enemy spells, etc\n- Wis is useful for endurance, and controls your Mana attribute\n- Cha is for raw damage and contests of will\n\n\n## Gifted\n\nSome people are just born with gifts. Maybe you're stronger or faster than you ought to be. Maybe you have an innate magical ability. This is a relatively simple class that grants bonuses that most adventurers would find useful, such as:\n- ability boosts\n- bonuses to defense\n- bonuses to natural attacks\n- innate magical abilities, especially passive ones\n\n\n\n## Monster\n\nSimilar to Gifted, but usually with a distinct flavor and more power, but also significant disadvantages, such as Vampire or Werewolf.\n\n\n\n\n# Class Skills\n\nWell, that's all well and good. But maybe skills are the answer. Not sure how to balance them all yet, but many of the core abilities work fine as skills. For example:\n\n\n## Thaumaturgy\n\nUses:\n- create and use phylactery\n- detect vestigia / match vestigium to caster\n\n\n## Invocation\n\n- Detect planar alignment\n- Magic circle\n- Summon outsider\n- Command outsider\n- Banish outsider\n\n## Arcana\n\n- Bind magic into symbols, items, words\n- Learn from other practitioner's arcana\n\n## Psionics\n\n- Achieve mental focus\n- Defend your mind against intrusion\n- Open yourself to psychic impressions\n- Organize your thoughts; identify intrusive or foreign thoughts\n- Cleanse yourself of mental impurities\n- Psychic chirurgery\n\n\n## Spellcraft\n- Cast ritual spell\n- Identify spell (what does it do, how to counter it)\n- Modify spell as you cast it (spell stunt)\n\n## Concentration\n- Resist corruption\n- Resist interruption\n- Keep control of spell during ritual casting\n\n## Willpower\n- Dominate outsider\n- Win contest of wills\n- Resist mental intrusion\n\n\n\n## Proficiency bonuses\nYou might ask, how do you roll these crazy skills? Is Arcana Int based? Cha? Wis? Which is which?\n\nWell, it's time for skills to part ways with the concept of permanent ability score assignments. Fact is, skills represent training, not fundamental talent. Thus, they provide the \"training\" portion of the roll, and ability scores provide the \"talent\" portion. There's no reason they have to marry one particular score.\n\nFor example, a selection of Invocation's uses:\n- Detect Planar Alignment: roll a Wisdom check (add your Invocation proficiency) to detect the planar alignment of a creature of spell. Any creature native to another plane, or any magical effect they produce (whether personally or invoked by a mortal proxy) carries a signature of that plane, which you can identify with a successful check.\n- Summon outsider: name a specific outsider, or a class of similar ones (such as \"imp\" or \"succubus\"). You must defeat the outsider in an opposed Charisma check (add your Invocation proficiency bonus).\n- Resist Corruption: whenever the DM attempts to invoke your Corruption to make you act against your wishes, you can roll a Wisdom check (with Invocation proficiency bonus) to negate the action.\n\nSimilarly, a selection from the Melee skill:\n- Attack with a heavy, two-handed weapon: roll Strength + Melee proficiency. This sets the DC for the enemy's defense roll.\n- Attack with a light, one-handed weapon: roll Dexterity + Melee proficiency. This set the DC for the enemy's defense roll.\n\nMic fucking dropped.\n\n\n### Actual Proficiency Bonuses\n\nA few things:\n- There is a baseline. 5e had one, obv. 4e's was 1/2 level. Something like that.\n- The initial bump from \"not proficient\" to \"proficient\" is significant. Maybe +4 or +5.\n- There could be multiple levels, a la PF2 (or certain versions of S7). One such take:\n  - Proficient: +4\n  - Expert: +7\n  - Master: +9\n  - Legend: +10\n  - With additional benefits beyond just the numeric bonus.","bodyHtml":"<h1>8.1</h1>\n<h1>Basics</h1>\n<p>Considering a change to basic formulas. Candidates include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>5e style (every check is stat + optional proficiency; may have multiple levels of proficiency)</li>\n<li>actual classes (hybrids?)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Core magical abilities</h1>\n<p>Whither rituals? And <em>detect magic</em>? All the stuff practitioners should have, but aren't about to sink an entire power on it? How do they get these abilities?</p>\n<p>Considering the archetypal characters, there seems to be a three-way tradeoff. That is, you have a given amount to invest into three categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pure caster</li>\n<li>Monster/enhanced</li>\n<li>Exceptional fighter/rogue/etc</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But it's not quite so simple. System 8 explicitly doesn't let you trade away powers; you don't have to have spell-like abilities, but you have to have something: super strength, uncanny luck, even if it's not from your blood, but from a cool item or something. It's essential to maintain some sort of balance.</p>\n<p>This would seem to imply that there are really only two &quot;classes&quot; per se:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pure Caster</li>\n<li>Innate Power (monster, enhanced, cool item, etc)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So who is good at fighting? Well, melee attacks or whatever aren't really on this spectrum. Whatever normal HP, ACs, attack and damage rolls, etc that a level X caster can achieve, a level X innate can use their power to easily overmatch them. Training should matter, too, of course, but it seems like the job is mostly taken care of by ability scores. The true &quot;glass cannon&quot; style of pure caster will entirely neglect their physical stats and be rubbish at physical combat, whereas an innate power user should have little use for most of the mental stats and will necessarily have more focus in the physical ones (if not more ability score points overall due to said innate power).</p>\n<p>This doesn't suit a 3.5 base very well. Two classes isn't a great look for d20, especially since neither fits any of the in-between abilities like Reflex. It might work with a 5e base somewhat better, where we just let people pick their ability scores as normal, and let proficiency separate the level bands. Maybe we can borrow something from PF2 and have different levels of proficiency (proficient, expert, etc).</p>\n<p>So what does this look like? Let's talk specifics.</p>\n<h1>The &quot;Classes&quot;</h1>\n<p>There are really only two, but we'll pretend there are more by shifting the label of &quot;class&quot; down to the level of subclass. Thus:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Practitioners\n<ul>\n<li>Invoker</li>\n<li>Elementalist</li>\n<li>Thaumaturge</li>\n<li>Arcanist</li>\n<li>Psion</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Monsters\n<ul>\n<li>Vampire</li>\n<li>Elemental</li>\n<li>Undead</li>\n<li>Sylvan</li>\n<li>etc</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Innate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fuck, no. It doesn't work. What if you're an innate power user who uses Invocation bindings? Why have separate classes for Elemental and Elementalist?</p>\n<p>Well, the other approach would seem to be:</p>\n<h1>Classes and Powers</h1>\n<p>Classes describe training, skills, experience, hard work, knowledge, etc. Powers are cool supernatural things you can do. They are separate game mechanics.</p>\n<p>A power is something like &quot;Fireball&quot;. Maybe you can make a fireball because you're a wizard who has studied magic for years and knows the arcane symbols and words to evoke one. Maybe you can do so because you're a sorcerer and fire is in your blood; you don't have to think about it, magic just comes out.
