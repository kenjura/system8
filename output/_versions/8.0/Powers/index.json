{"name":"index","contents":"Powers are abilities that are supernatural or extraordinary in nature that make you...well, more powerful.\r\n\r\nSpells are an obvious type of power, but there are others, such as passive or constant effects, supernatural objects or gear, or even the effect of your legacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nMechanically, powers are simple: you gain 1 per level, plus 1 at character creation (i.e. level \"0\"). You can select any power as long as you meet any specific requirements it calls out.\r\n\r\nFor convenience, powers are organized into groups.
