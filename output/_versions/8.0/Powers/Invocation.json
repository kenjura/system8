{"name":"Invocation","contents":"# Invoker\n\nCommonly--and quite inaccurately--named \"warlocks\", Invokers are magical practitioners who specialize in invoking the powers of Outer Planes, and of the denizens therein.\n\nA common misconception is that Invokers have a solitary, unbreakable bond with a single planar overlord. While this arrangement is not unheard of, it rarely results in a long and lucrative career for the Invoker. Anybody can sell their soul--that doesn't make them a Invoker. Instead, the wise Invoker follows the Principle of Equal Exchange, the fundamental law of the Pact. In essence, all Outsiders, regardless of outward appearance or presumed morality, are supernaturally bound to honor contracts and deals, and when a debt is repaid, it is repaid. The devil is, of course, in the details, and thus the true measure of a successful Invoker is whether they can harness the power of Outsiders without becoming hopelessly entrapped by them.\n\nOf course, it is hardly uncommon for a Invoker not to have some sort of debt or kinship he can't easily rid himself of, and this is handled separately. As a rule, Invoker spells and rituals are self-balancing and do not imply permanent debt, while [[#Corruption]] results when a Invoker, wittingly or otherwise, permanently exchanges some sort of debt or bondage in exchange for power.\n\n\n# Basic Abilities\n\n<!--\nAttribute     | Value\n---------     | -----\nHit Die       | d8\nHP/level      | 5\nWeapon Prof.  | None\nArmor Prof.   | None\nSaving Throws | Int, Cha\n-->\n\nBrief version:\n- Your primary limiting factor is Corruption, an attribute describing how much your planar powers have corrupted your soul. You gain it by using expensive powers, and reduce it by either purifying yourself or coercing others into accepting some of it. You can gain a lot of power by accepting permanent Corruption.\n- Summons: corruption-free, loyal extraplanar minions that you can improve with feats.\n- Bindings: permanent or at-will magical abilities that generally don't cause corruption to use, because you already accepted permanent corruption to gain them.\n- Invocations: spell-like abilities which generally cause corruption, but are quite powerful.\n\n\n# Core skills\n- Spellcraft (Int): used to conduct invocation rituals, such as summoning, banishing, or commanding extraplanar creatures.\n- Concentration (Wis): used to resist Corruption.\n- Willpower (Cha): your ability to command loyalty or otherwise impose your will upon extraplanar creatures.\n\nUses:\n- Spellcraft\n  - Detect planar alignment: detects extraplanar creatures, portals, extraplanar magical effects. Determine planar origin of same.\n  - Magic circle: creates a magical barrier for containing extraplanar creatures, or protecting yourself from same.\n  - Summon outsider: summons an extraplanar creature.\n  - Command outsider: subjects an extraplanar creature to your will.\n  - Banish outsider: sends an extraplanar creature back to its home plane.\n- Concentration\n  - Resist Corruption\n- Willpower\n  - Used during Summon, Command, and Banish\n  - Determines most abilities of bound minions\n  - \n\n\n# Corruption\n- Minimum: 0\n- Threshold: 1/2 level + Wis\n\nBelow the threshold, Corruption has no in-game effect (but may have several minor cosmetic effects). When at or above the threshold, you must pass Concentration checks each time you gain Corruption, and at certain other times determined by the DM.\n\nA Concentration check's DC is equal to 10 + your Corruption.\n- Complete success: no effect.\n- Mixed success: you are Tempted, a state the DM can take advantage of at a later time.\n- Failure: you are Tainted. At any time, the DM can attempt to compel you into an action you might not have otherwise willed.\n\nWhen \"Tempted\", the DM can, at an opportune time, offer you a deal on behalf of the planar forces from which you gain power. This must be at a time when your character would be reasonably willing to borrow power for some worthwhile gain. The deal is generally the same as any other action you might have taken: for a given Corruption cost, you gain a certain effect. However, the power can be something you couldn't normally access, or have a powerful enhancement such as using it while you are incapacitated, or as an immediate action, or having empowered effect. In any case, you must pass a Concentration check to resist (you can voluntarily fail if you choose). If you fail the check, you gain 1 (or more, if specified) Corruption, along with the designated benefit. The \"Tempted\" state disappears, but naturally, you must now roll a fresh Concentration check since you just gained Corruption.\n\nWhen you are \"Tainted\", the DM can, at any time, attempt to force you to take actions. These actions can be anything, although they will generally serve the purposes of whatever planar source powers you--as opposed to being simply inconvenient or downright hostile to you and your allies. To resist, you must pass a Concentration check.\n- Complete success: you don't take the action, and instead act however you wish.\n- Mixed success: you don't take the action, but you lose your turn, or instead gain 1 Corruption.\n- Failure: you take the action.\n- In any case, after the roll and the subsequent action, your Corruption decreases by 1. If it falls below the threshold, you are no longer Tainted.\n\n\n# Relieving/Mitigating Corruption\n\nReduce Corruption you have gained is possible, but it takes time. Some of the most reliable ways are to purify yourself with an opposing energy (e.g. prayer or service to a good deity can remove the taint of Infernal power), or to coerce other mortals into service to your planar faction (e.g. tempting mortals to sin please the Infernal plane, rewarding you with reduced Corruption and therfore more agency to continue your great work).\n\nIn game terms, the above is a \"down time\" action that generally takes longer than a long rest and only fits into the time between episodes. Many adventurers need a quicker fix than that. There are a few other ways to rid yourself of Corruption, or indeed prevent it before it occurs:\n\n- Soul Shards: shards of mortal souls are the most valuable commodity in every non-prime plane, worth far more than gold or diamonds. Invokers can capture shards of mortal souls--or even souls entire--and place them into tradeable form. Although one cannot promise anything on behalf of another mortal, it is much easier for an outsider to parley with a mortal on their own terms, deep within their plane, then it is on the Prime Material. Thus, soul shards can pay off Corruption, or otherwise purchase Corruption-free power. This is generally not a morally justifiable decision, if you're concerned about that sort of thing.\n- Contract: by communing with representatives of your planar source, you can enter a contract where you perform some service, in exchange for relief of a given amount of Corruption.\n- Transfer: Corruption is a commodity. You accept it into your soul when you willingly choose to. Others can accept it from you, just as they could have accepted it from your planar source. Thus, you can arrange a transfer with any other Invoker, extraplanar creature, deity, or other suitably magical being with its own will, if you can otherwise get them to agree to it.\n\n\n\n# Bindings\n\nBindings do not cost feats or powers. When you accept a binding, you permanently gain its effect, and increase your minimum Corruption by the amount listed.\n\n**You can spend a feat to reduce Corruption cost of a given binding by 1.**\n\nName         | Corruption | Effect\n-------------|------------|-------\nArmor        | 1          | Gain a bonus to Armor equal to Cha + 1/2 level.

Also:\n  - 1 Corruption: fairies steal a held item from target and deliver it to you or other location within range (Reflex negates)\n  - 2 Corruption: fairies remove all worn/held items from target, delivering them to location within range (Reflex negates each item)\n\n## Sensation\n- Glamour: you change your appearance at will, either disguising your identity, or decorating yourself to appear more comely.\n  - 0 corruption: change apparent identity to another member of same creature type and size (i.e. medium humanoid)\n  - 1 corruption: change type, or size within 1 category. Effect is illusionary (Will disbelieves, but otherwise damage is real and psychic)\n  - 1 corruption: targets not in combat are fascinated by you (Will ends, ends if they take damage or you attack)\n  - 1 corruption per target: appearance creates emotional effect, such as charm, unwillingness to harm you, belief you are in a position to give orders, etc. Will ends.\n- Magic Fingers: at-will, touch, 1 Corruption; you cause subject to experience any physical sensation you can imagine, within their mental capabilities.

Anything crossing it suffers medium necrotic damage.\n- [Shadow Double](): At-will, swift, ranged, concentration; you create a shadowy double of yourself or a chosen subject. The double is under your control, and has the same physical abilities as the subject.

Subject suffers 1 level of enervation (-1 to all checks, disabled if enervation levels > hit dice). Choose one of the following:\n  - Fetish: you drain one of the subject's ability scores. They suffer a -4 penalty to that score while the soul shard exists, and you gain +4 to the same score. Lasts up to 24 hours.\n  - Phylactery: you use the soul fragment as the component for a phylactery (see [Create Phylactery]()).\n  - Steal Ability: you gain access to a single chosen power, maneuver, or skill that the subject possesses, while you retain the shard. Lasts up to 24 hours.\n\n\n# Void\n- [Star of the Void](): At-will, std, ranged; you summon a mote of pure void that annihilates anything it touches. Each round that you spend an action to control it, it moves as you desire, flying up to 10 squares and attacking one target (optionally). Target suffers heavy disintegration damage on contact (Reflex half). If you do not spend an action to control it, it acts however it wants (use the *Confusion* rules). To end the spell, you must spend an action to send it away. Anyone else with knowledge of this spell can contest your will for control of the Star.\n- [Disintegrate](): At-will, std, ranged; heavy disintegration damage (Fort half).\n- [Void Shield](): At-will, swift, concentration; you \"wield\" a disc of absolute blackness. As a reaction, you can absorb any incoming targeted effect. Spells and projectiles are annihilated on contact. Melee attackers can roll Reflex to pull back their attack; if they fail to do so, their weapon is annihilated. Unarmed attackers get a similar save to avoid heavy disintegration damage. Magic items get a Willpower save to avoid destruction. This spell is probably OP.\n- [Hungering Void](): At-will, std, ranged, 1 square; you tear open a hole in reality, sucking everything toward it, and ejecting whatever falls into it into deepest night. This spell is super OP and I have to figure out how to balance it.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Feats\nEach time you select one of the below feats, you also gain:\n- +1 HP/level\n- +1 Spellcraft, Concentration, Willpower\n- +0.5 Fortitude, Reflex\n\n\n\n\n# Spell Enhancements\n- Mirror Image: modifies *Veil*.\n- Rainbow Beam: modifies *Color Spray*. Area changes to line 20x1 or 10x2. Each target is hit with a chosen color (can be different for each target).\n- Greater Sprites: modifies *Summon Sprite*. Existing sprites are enhanced, and new options added:\n  - Fire sprite: light fire damage plus half ongoing 3 rds.\n  - Frost sprite: light frost damage plus chilled (Fort ends).\n  - Wind sprite: light lightning damage plus same if subject leaves their square in the next 1 rd.\n  - Brain sprite: light psychic damage plus confusion (Will ends).\n  - Arcane sprite: light arcane damage, or a dispel attempt. On sacrifice, dispel all instances of a spell in a burst 2.\n  - Death sprite: light necrotic damage plus Resist 50% (healing) for 3 rds.\n\n\n# Bladebound\n- Bound Arms: at-will, swift; you \"summon\" one of your minions, but rather than giving them an independent form, you bind them into the shape of a weapon, or into the form of an existing weapon. In the former case, the weapon's stats are equal to a normal martial weapon you are proficient with.\n  - Imp: adds medium fire damage, plus light fire ongoing for 3 rds.\n  - Pixie: can put enemies to sleep, or adds +10 critical threat range.\n  - Succubus: adds medium necrotic damage, can entangle and wrack.\n- Fusion: at-will, swift; you \"summon\" one of your minions, but rather than giving them an independent form, you bind them into the shape of armor, or into the form of your existing armor. In the former case, the armor's stats are equal to a normal armor type you are proficient with. Examples:\n  - Voidwalker: Absorb 50% (any), limit medium damage each round. Resist shadow/necrotic.\n  - etc\n- Armiger: summon a bunch of weapons at once, costs Corruption, etc.\n\n\n# Summoner\n- Rapid Summons: your minion-summoning spells with a standard action are now swift actions; those that were already swift are free (once/rd).\n- Soul Link: when a minion is within range, half the damage you suffer is transferred to them. Any death or loss-of-control effect you suffer has a 50% chance of transferring to the minion.\n- Sacrifice: at-will, reaction; you sacrifice an active minion, expending them as if they reached 0 HP, but producing a powerful effect:\n  - Imp: close burst 5, heavy fire damage plus half ongoing for 3 rds.\n  - Succubus: TBD\n  - Pixie: close burst 5, allies can choose to teleport anywhere in range that they can see, and they become invisible until they attack or take damage (or until 1 hour passes).\n  - Felhunter: close burst 5, dispel attempt against a chosen effect on each target, or dispel attempt against each effect on one target. Allies gain Resist 50% (magic) for 2 rounds.\n  - Voidwalker: close burst 5, allies gain Absorb 100% (all, limit Voidwalker's max HP).\n  - Sprite: close burst 2, same effect as a normal attack, but double damagee.\n- Evolution: advances your minion to a more powerful form. Examples:\n  - Void Knight: has Pound, Gravity, Shadowy Shield.\n  - Ethereal: more powerful shade that has enhanced abilities while ethereal.\n  - Sylph: pixie that can heal you, put enemies to sleep, aura grants allies bonus movement.\n  - Dread Stalker: more deadly felhunter. Has cool dredlocks. Has Phase Shift, Shadow Tunnel, grants allies magic detection.\n- Minion Resilience: your Minions gain 2 HP/level.\n- Share Senses: you gain your minions' extra senses.\n\n\n\n# Minions\n\nPowers such as [Summon Pixie]() grants you the listed minion as a permanent ally.\n\nAlthough each minion has a \"canonical\" flavor (e.g. Pixie is Fey, Imp is Infernal), all Invokers can select any minions they choose, and re-flavor as desired. A fey invoker might summon a \"redcap\" with Imp stats, or a Shadow invoker could summon a \"shadow stalker\" with Felhunter stats, for example.\n\nNotes on summoning:\n- You can only control one summoned minion at a time (summoned via an Invoker spell with \"summon\" in the title). The exception is Summon Sprites, which does not apply to the limit, nor do other summons apply to that spell's limit.\n- Invokers who use Willpower can attempt to control multiple minions at a time. Whenever the number of minions changes, and that number is higher than 1, roll Willpower opposed to Cha save for each minion; on success, they are controlled, and on failure, they run wild.\n- Minions have their own HP and Mana pools. When they reach 0 HP, they are immediately unsummoned, and cannot be summoned again for 24 hours, after which they are restored to 100% HP and Mana.\n- Minions can take a long rest, either in the prime material plane or when away from you.\n\n\n\n# Pixie\n- Ability scores: her Dex and Cha = your Int/Wis/Cha (whichever is highest), others are 0\n- Saves: Dex, Cha\n- Size: tiny\n- Movement: fly 6\n- AC: 10 + Dex\n- HP: 1 per level\n- Mana: 1 per level\n- Attacks:\n  - Needle: std, melee, Dex vs AC; light arcane damage.\n- Special:\n  - Sneak Attack: against unaware targets, inflict critical damage.\n  - Invisibility: swift, recharge 33%; pixie becomes invisible until she attacks or takes damage.\n  - Legerdemain: she is proficient in Acrobatics, Stealth, and Sleight of Hand\n  - Sleep: can put a single target to sleep on successful sneak attack if they are unaware.\n  - Pixie Dust: can cause a single target to laugh or sneeze uncontrollably (Con ends), or similar usage of dust (e.g. drug trips).\n\n## Evolution: Sylph\n- +2 HP/level\n- Healing Dust: recharge 33%, swift, touch; heals subject for medium damage.\n- Think Happy Thoughts: emanation 10; allies gain a fly speed equal to walking speed.\n- Arcane Arrow: at-will, std; medium arcane damage, 20/x3.\n- Improved Invisibility: Invisibility becomes at-will.\n\n\n# Felhunter\n- Ability scores: Str and Con = your Int/Wis/Cha (whichever is highest), Dex and Wis are half that, Int and Cha 0\n- Saves: Str, Con\n- Size: medium\n- Movement: walk 6\n- AC: 10 + Dex + proficiency bonus\n- HP: 2 per level\n- Attacks:\n  - Bite: std, melee, Str vs AC; light piercing damage, plus one special:\n    - Spell Lock: next spell subject casts, they must pass a Concentration check against the damage of the bite in order not to lose the spell.

One humanoid that the shade can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the shade; the shade then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The shade now controls the body but doesn’t deprive the target of awareness. The shade can’t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target’s statistics, but doesn’t gain access to the target’s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the shade ends it as a bonus action, or the shade is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the shade reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this shade’s Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.\n- Special:\n  - Ethereal Sight. The Shade can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.\n  - Scan: ranged, swift; determines the physical and metaphysical makeup of the target (level of intelligence, spellcasting, etc).\n\n## Variant: Spirit of Intellect\n- Replace Chill Touch with Steal Knowledge\n\n\n\n\n# Nightmare\n- http://5e.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/nightmare.htm\n\n\n## Astral Steed (variant)\n- Str +4 Dex +2 Con +3 Int +0 Wis +1 Cha +5\n- Walk 60-ft, Fly 90-ft\n- HP 2 per level\n- Defenses:\n  - Immune to color-based magic\n  - Resist (arcane)\n- Attacks:\n  - Hoof: std melee; (str+prof) vs AC, medium bludgeoning damage plus one Color Spray effect\n\n### Evolution\n- Astral Jaunt","bodyHtml":"<h1>Invoker</h1>\n<p>Commonly--and quite inaccurately--named &quot;warlocks&quot;, Invokers are magical practitioners who specialize in invoking the powers of Outer Planes, and of the denizens therein.</p>\n<p>A common misconception is that Invokers have a solitary, unbreakable bond with a single planar overlord. While this arrangement is not unheard of, it rarely results in a long and lucrative career for the Invoker. Anybody can sell their soul--that doesn't make them a Invoker. Instead, the wise Invoker follows the Principle of Equal Exchange, the fundamental law of the Pact. In essence, all Outsiders, regardless of outward appearance or presumed morality, are supernaturally bound to honor contracts and deals, and when a debt is repaid, it is repaid. The devil is, of course, in the details, and thus the true measure of a successful Invoker is whether they can harness the power of Outsiders without becoming hopelessly entrapped by them.</p>\n<p>Of course, it is hardly uncommon for a Invoker not to have some sort of debt or kinship he can't easily rid himself of, and this is handled separately. As a rule, Invoker spells and rituals are self-balancing and do not imply permanent debt, while [[#Corruption]] results when a Invoker, wittingly or otherwise, permanently exchanges some sort of debt or bondage in exchange for power.</p>\n<h1>Basic Abilities</h1>\n<!--\nAttribute     | Value\n---------     | -----\nHit Die       | d8\nHP/level      | 5\nWeapon Prof.  | None\nArmor Prof.   | None\nSaving Throws | Int, Cha\n-->\n<p>Brief version:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your primary limiting factor is Corruption, an attribute describing how much your planar powers have corrupted your soul. You gain it by using expensive powers, and reduce it by either purifying yourself or coercing others into accepting some of it. You can gain a lot of power by accepting permanent Corruption.</li>\n<li>Summons: corruption-free, loyal extraplanar minions that you can improve with feats.</li>\n<li>Bindings: permanent or at-will magical abilities that generally don't cause corruption to use, because you already accepted permanent corruption to gain them.</li>\n<li>Invocations: spell-like abilities which generally cause corruption, but are quite powerful.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Core skills</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Spellcraft (Int): used to conduct invocation rituals, such as summoning, banishing, or commanding extraplanar creatures.</li>\n<li>Concentration (Wis): used to resist Corruption.</li>\n<li>Willpower (Cha): your ability to command loyalty or otherwise impose your will upon extraplanar creatures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Uses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spellcraft\n<ul>\n<li>Detect planar alignment: detects extraplanar creatures, portals, extraplanar magical effects. Determine planar origin of same.</li>\n<li>Magic circle: creates a magical barrier for containing extraplanar creatures, or protecting yourself from same.</li>\n<li>Summon outsider: summons an extraplanar creature.</li>\n<li>Command outsider: subjects an extraplanar creature to your will.</li>\n<li>Banish outsider: sends an extraplanar creature back to its home plane.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Concentration\n<ul>\n<li>Resist Corruption</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Willpower\n<ul>\n<li>Used during Summon, Command, and Banish</li>\n<li>Determines most abilities of bound minions</li>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Corruption</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Minimum: 0</li>\n<li>Threshold: 1/2 level + Wis</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below the threshold, Corruption has no in-game effect (but may have several minor cosmetic effects). When at or above the threshold, you must pass Concentration checks each time you gain Corruption, and at certain other times determined by the DM.</p>\n<p>A Concentration check's DC is equal to 10 + your Corruption.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete success: no effect.</li>\n<li>Mixed success: you are Tempted, a state the DM can take advantage of at a later time.</li>\n<li>Failure: you are Tainted. At any time, the DM can attempt to compel you into an action you might not have otherwise willed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When &quot;Tempted&quot;, the DM can, at an opportune time, offer you a deal on behalf of the planar forces from which you gain power. This must be at a time when your character would be reasonably willing to borrow power for some worthwhile gain. The deal is generally the same as any other action you might have taken: for a given Corruption cost, you gain a certain effect. However, the power can be something you couldn't normally access, or have a powerful enhancement such as using it while you are incapacitated, or as an immediate action, or having empowered effect. In any case, you must pass a Concentration check to resist (you can voluntarily fail if you choose). If you fail the check, you gain 1 (or more, if specified) Corruption, along with the designated benefit. The &quot;Tempted&quot; state disappears, but naturally, you must now roll a fresh Concentration check since you just gained Corruption.</p>\n<p>When you are &quot;Tainted&quot;, the DM can, at any time, attempt to force you to take actions. These actions can be anything, although they will generally serve the purposes of whatever planar source powers you--as opposed to being simply inconvenient or downright hostile to you and your allies. To resist, you must pass a Concentration check.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete success: you don't take the action, and instead act however you wish.</li>\n<li>Mixed success: you don't take the action, but you lose your turn, or instead gain 1 Corruption.</li>\n<li>Failure: you take the action.</li>\n<li>In any case, after the roll and the subsequent action, your Corruption decreases by 1. If it falls below the threshold, you are no longer Tainted.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Relieving/Mitigating Corruption</h1>\n<p>Reduce Corruption you have gained is possible, but it takes time. Some of the most reliable ways are to purify yourself with an opposing energy (e.g. prayer or service to a good deity can remove the taint of Infernal power), or to coerce other mortals into service to your planar faction (e.g. tempting mortals to sin please the Infernal plane, rewarding you with reduced Corruption and therfore more agency to continue your great work).</p>\n<p>In game terms, the above is a &quot;down time&quot; action that generally takes longer than a long rest and only fits into the time between episodes. Many adventurers need a quicker fix than that. There are a few other ways to rid yourself of Corruption, or indeed prevent it before it occurs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Soul Shards: shards of mortal souls are the most valuable commodity in every non-prime plane, worth far more than gold or diamonds. Invokers can capture shards of mortal souls--or even souls entire--and place them into tradeable form. Although one cannot promise anything on behalf of another mortal, it is much easier for an outsider to parley with a mortal on their own terms, deep within their plane, then it is on the Prime Material. Thus, soul shards can pay off Corruption, or otherwise purchase Corruption-free power. This is generally not a morally justifiable decision, if you're concerned about that sort of thing.</li>\n<li>Contract: by communing with representatives of your planar source, you can enter a contract where you perform some service, in exchange for relief of a given amount of Corruption.</li>\n<li>Transfer: Corruption is a commodity. You accept it into your soul when you willingly choose to. Others can accept it from you, just as they could have accepted it from your planar source. Thus, you can arrange a transfer with any other Invoker, extraplanar creature, deity, or other suitably magical being with its own will, if you can otherwise get them to agree to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Bindings</h1>\n<p>Bindings do not cost feats or powers. When you accept a binding, you permanently gain its effect, and increase your minimum Corruption by the amount listed.</p>\n<p><strong>You can spend a feat to reduce Corruption cost of a given binding by 1.</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Corruption</th>\n<th>Effect</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Armor</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Gain a bonus to Armor equal to Cha + 1/2 level.

A fey invoker might summon a &quot;redcap&quot; with Imp stats, or a Shadow invoker could summon a &quot;shadow stalker&quot; with Felhunter stats, for example.</p>\n<p>Notes on summoning:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can only control one summoned minion at a time (summoned via an Invoker spell with &quot;summon&quot; in the title). The exception is Summon Sprites, which does not apply to the limit, nor do other summons apply to that spell's limit.</li>\n<li>Invokers who use Willpower can attempt to control multiple minions at a time. Whenever the number of minions changes, and that number is higher than 1, roll Willpower opposed to Cha save for each minion; on success, they are controlled, and on failure, they run wild.</li>\n<li>Minions have their own HP and Mana pools. When they reach 0 HP, they are immediately unsummoned, and cannot be summoned again for 24 hours, after which they are restored to 100% HP and Mana.</li>\n<li>Minions can take a long rest, either in the prime material plane or when away from you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Pixie</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability scores: her Dex and Cha = your Int/Wis/Cha (whichever is highest), others are 0</li>\n<li>Saves: Dex, Cha</li>\n<li>Size: tiny</li>\n<li>Movement: fly 6</li>\n<li>AC: 10 + Dex</li>\n<li>HP: 1 per level</li>\n<li>Mana: 1 per level</li>\n<li>Attacks:\n<ul>\n<li>Needle: std, melee, Dex vs AC; light arcane damage.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Special:\n<ul>\n<li>Sneak Attack: against unaware targets, inflict critical damage.</li>\n<li>Invisibility: swift, recharge 33%; pixie becomes invisible until she attacks or takes damage.</li>\n<li>Legerdemain: she is proficient in Acrobatics, Stealth, and Sleight of Hand</li>\n<li>Sleep: can put a single target to sleep on successful sneak attack if they are unaware.</li>\n<li>Pixie Dust: can cause a single target to laugh or sneeze uncontrollably (Con ends), or similar usage of dust (e.g. drug trips).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Evolution: Sylph</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>+2 HP/level</li>\n<li>Healing Dust: recharge 33%, swift, touch; heals subject for medium damage.</li>\n<li>Think Happy Thoughts: emanation 10; allies gain a fly speed equal to walking speed.</li>\n<li>Arcane Arrow: at-will, std; medium arcane damage, 20/x3.</li>\n<li>Improved Invisibility: Invisibility becomes at-will.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Felhunter</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability scores: Str and Con = your Int/Wis/Cha (whichever is highest), Dex and Wis are half that, Int and Cha 0</li>\n<li>Saves: Str, Con</li>\n<li>Size: medium</li>\n<li>Movement: walk 6</li>\n<li>AC: 10 + Dex + proficiency bonus</li>\n<li>HP: 2 per level</li>\n<li>Attacks:\n<ul>\n<li>Bite: std, melee, Str vs AC; light piercing damage, plus one special:\n<ul>\n<li>Spell Lock: next spell subject casts, they must pass a Concentration check against the damage of the bite in order not to lose the spell.

One humanoid that the shade can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the shade; the shade then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The shade now controls the body but doesn’t deprive the target of awareness. The shade can’t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target’s statistics, but doesn’t gain access to the target’s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the shade ends it as a bonus action, or the shade is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the shade reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this shade’s Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Special:\n<ul>\n<li>Ethereal Sight.
