<contents># Invoker

Commonly--and quite inaccurately--named &#34;warlocks&#34;, Invokers are magical practitioners who specialize in invoking the powers of Outer Planes, and of the denizens therein.

A common misconception is that Invokers have a solitary, unbreakable bond with a single planar overlord. While this arrangement is not unheard of, it rarely results in a long and lucrative career for the Invoker. Anybody can sell their soul--that doesn't make them a Invoker. Instead, the wise Invoker follows the Principle of Equal Exchange, the fundamental law of the Pact. In essence, all Outsiders, regardless of outward appearance or presumed morality, are supernaturally bound to honor contracts and deals, and when a debt is repaid, it is repaid. The devil is, of course, in the details, and thus the true measure of a successful Invoker is whether they can harness the power of Outsiders without becoming hopelessly entrapped by them.

Of course, it is hardly uncommon for a Invoker not to have some sort of debt or kinship he can't easily rid himself of, and this is handled separately. As a rule, Invoker spells and rituals are self-balancing and do not imply permanent debt, while [[#Corruption]] results when a Invoker, wittingly or otherwise, permanently exchanges some sort of debt or bondage in exchange for power.


# Basic Abilities

&lt;!--
Attribute     | Value
---------     | -----
Hit Die       | d8
HP/level      | 5
Weapon Prof.  | None
Armor Prof.   | None
Saving Throws | Int, Cha
--&gt;

Brief version:
- Your primary limiting factor is Corruption, an attribute describing how much your planar powers have corrupted your soul. You gain it by using expensive powers, and reduce it by either purifying yourself or coercing others into accepting some of it. You can gain a lot of power by accepting permanent Corruption.
- Summons: corruption-free, loyal extraplanar minions that you can improve with feats.
- Bindings: permanent or at-will magical abilities that generally don't cause corruption to use, because you already accepted permanent corruption to gain them.
- Invocations: spell-like abilities which generally cause corruption, but are quite powerful.


# Core skills
- Spellcraft (Int): used to conduct invocation rituals, such as summoning, banishing, or commanding extraplanar creatures.
- Concentration (Wis): used to resist Corruption.
- Willpower (Cha): your ability to command loyalty or otherwise impose your will upon extraplanar creatures.

Uses:
- Spellcraft
  - Detect planar alignment: detects extraplanar creatures, portals, extraplanar magical effects. Determine planar origin of same.
  - Magic circle: creates a magical barrier for containing extraplanar creatures, or protecting yourself from same.
  - Summon outsider: summons an extraplanar creature.
  - Command outsider: subjects an extraplanar creature to your will.
  - Banish outsider: sends an extraplanar creature back to its home plane.
- Concentration
  - Resist Corruption
- Willpower
  - Used during Summon, Command, and Banish
  - Determines most abilities of bound minions
  - 


# Corruption
- Minimum: 0
- Threshold: 1/2 level + Wis

Below the threshold, Corruption has no in-game effect (but may have several minor cosmetic effects). When at or above the threshold, you must pass Concentration checks each time you gain Corruption, and at certain other times determined by the DM.

A Concentration check's DC is equal to 10 + your Corruption.
- Complete success: no effect.
- Mixed success: you are Tempted, a state the DM can take advantage of at a later time.
- Failure: you are Tainted. At any time, the DM can attempt to compel you into an action you might not have otherwise willed.

When &#34;Tempted&#34;, the DM can, at an opportune time, offer you a deal on behalf of the planar forces from which you gain power. This must be at a time when your character would be reasonably willing to borrow power for some worthwhile gain. The deal is generally the same as any other action you might have taken: for a given Corruption cost, you gain a certain effect. However, the power can be something you couldn't normally access, or have a powerful enhancement such as using it while you are incapacitated, or as an immediate action, or having empowered effect. In any case, you must pass a Concentration check to resist (you can voluntarily fail if you choose). If you fail the check, you gain 1 (or more, if specified) Corruption, along with the designated benefit. The &#34;Tempted&#34; state disappears, but naturally, you must now roll a fresh Concentration check since you just gained Corruption.

When you are &#34;Tainted&#34;, the DM can, at any time, attempt to force you to take actions. These actions can be anything, although they will generally serve the purposes of whatever planar source powers you--as opposed to being simply inconvenient or downright hostile to you and your allies. To resist, you must pass a Concentration check.
- Complete success: you don't take the action, and instead act however you wish.
- Mixed success: you don't take the action, but you lose your turn, or instead gain 1 Corruption.
- Failure: you take the action.
- In any case, after the roll and the subsequent action, your Corruption decreases by 1. If it falls below the threshold, you are no longer Tainted.


# Relieving/Mitigating Corruption

Reduce Corruption you have gained is possible, but it takes time. Some of the most reliable ways are to purify yourself with an opposing energy (e.g. prayer or service to a good deity can remove the taint of Infernal power), or to coerce other mortals into service to your planar faction (e.g. tempting mortals to sin please the Infernal plane, rewarding you with reduced Corruption and therfore more agency to continue your great work).

In game terms, the above is a &#34;down time&#34; action that generally takes longer than a long rest and only fits into the time between episodes. Many adventurers need a quicker fix than that. There are a few other ways to rid yourself of Corruption, or indeed prevent it before it occurs:

- Soul Shards: shards of mortal souls are the most valuable commodity in every non-prime plane, worth far more than gold or diamonds. Invokers can capture shards of mortal souls--or even souls entire--and place them into tradeable form. Although one cannot promise anything on behalf of another mortal, it is much easier for an outsider to parley with a mortal on their own terms, deep within their plane, then it is on the Prime Material. Thus, soul shards can pay off Corruption, or otherwise purchase Corruption-free power. This is generally not a morally justifiable decision, if you're concerned about that sort of thing.
- Contract: by communing with representatives of your planar source, you can enter a contract where you perform some service, in exchange for relief of a given amount of Corruption.
- Transfer: Corruption is a commodity. You accept it into your soul when you willingly choose to. Others can accept it from you, just as they could have accepted it from your planar source. Thus, you can arrange a transfer with any other Invoker, extraplanar creature, deity, or other suitably magical being with its own will, if you can otherwise get them to agree to it.



# Bindings

Bindings do not cost feats or powers. When you accept a binding, you permanently gain its effect, and increase your minimum Corruption by the amount listed.

**You can spend a feat to reduce Corruption cost of a given binding by 1.**

Name         | Corruption | Effect

Mistform     | 3          | At-will, swift; you become gaseous, gaining a fly speed of 2 squares.
Vampirism    | 3          | When you inflict damage, you heal yourself for 10% of the damage dealt.
True Seeing  | 5          | You see a telltale outline around all illusion or shape-changing magic, giving it away. The true form thus disguised is revealed to you through the illusion.

# Shadow



## Notes


Special mechanics:
- Can conjure Forbidden Knowledge, gaining new invocations/feats at the cost of sanity.

Ideas:
- Curse of Doom: puts the Final Destination curse on someone.
- Demi
- 



## Summons

- [Summon Shadow](): Ranged; you summon a literal shadow--a two-dimensional projection of darkness that exists on walls, floors, etc. It is silent, and can't interact with the three-dimensional world, but makes a good spy.
- [Summon Voidwalker](): Ranged; you summon a hulking brute made of darkness that protects you.
- [Summon Shade](): Ranged; you summon an incorporeal shadow that can possess mortals.



## Shadow
- [Shadowstuff](): You make stuff out of shadow. TBI
- [Wall of Shadows](): At-will, std, wall 1/level, concentration; 20-ft high wall of total darkness blocks line of sight and line of effect for spells. Anything crossing it suffers medium necrotic damage.
- [Shadow Double](): At-will, swift, ranged, concentration; you create a shadowy double of yourself or a chosen subject. The double is under your control, and has the same physical abilities as the subject. You can cast spells through the double, using your own actions, mana, etc.
- [Shadow Walk](): You can shift in and out of the Shadow Realm. TBI


# Darkness
- Absorb Light
- Fear
- Madness



## Drain
- [Drain Life](): at-will, std, ranged; medium necrotic damage, plus you heal yourself the same amount. Overheal becomes temporary HP (expires at the end of the encounter, max value is 100% of max HP).
- [Drain Mana](): at-will, std, ranged; you drain 1d3+1 Mana from subject (if they have it), gaining the same as temporary Mana (expires at the end of the encounter). For every 5 levels of Invoker, gain +1 bonus drain and +1 die type (d3-&gt;d4-&gt;d6-&gt;etc).
- [Drain Soul](): at-will, std, ranged; you extract a portion of the subject's soul, forming it into a glowing, black crystal called a Soul Shard. Subject suffers 1 level of enervation (-1 to all checks, disabled if enervation levels &gt; hit dice). Choose one of the following:
  - Fetish: you drain one of the subject's ability scores. They suffer a -4 penalty to that score while the soul shard exists, and you gain +4 to the same score. Lasts up to 24 hours.
  - Phylactery: you use the soul fragment as the component for a phylactery (see [Create Phylactery]()).
  - Steal Ability: you gain access to a single chosen power, maneuver, or skill that the subject possesses, while you retain the shard. Lasts up to 24 hours.


# Void
- [Star of the Void](): At-will, std, ranged; you summon a mote of pure void that annihilates anything it touches. Each round that you spend an action to control it, it moves as you desire, flying up to 10 squares and attacking one target (optionally). Target suffers heavy disintegration damage on contact (Reflex half). If you do not spend an action to control it, it acts however it wants (use the *Confusion* rules). To end the spell, you must spend an action to send it away. Anyone else with knowledge of this spell can contest your will for control of the Star.
- [Disintegrate](): At-will, std, ranged; heavy disintegration damage (Fort half).
- [Void Shield](): At-will, swift, concentration; you &#34;wield&#34; a disc of absolute blackness. As a reaction, you can absorb any incoming targeted effect. Spells and projectiles are annihilated on contact. Melee attackers can roll Reflex to pull back their attack; if they fail to do so, their weapon is annihilated. Unarmed attackers get a similar save to avoid heavy disintegration damage. Magic items get a Willpower save to avoid destruction. This spell is probably OP.
- [Hungering Void](): At-will, std, ranged, 1 square; you tear open a hole in reality, sucking everything toward it, and ejecting whatever falls into it into deepest night. This spell is super OP and I have to figure out how to balance it.

  - Death sprite: light necrotic damage plus Resist 50% (healing) for 3 rds.


# Bladebound
- Bound Arms: at-will, swift; you &#34;summon&#34; one of your minions, but rather than giving them an independent form, you bind them into the shape of a weapon, or into the form of an existing weapon. In the former case, the weapon's stats are equal to a normal martial weapon you are proficient with.
  - Imp: adds medium fire damage, plus light fire ongoing for 3 rds.

  - Succubus: adds medium necrotic damage, can entangle and wrack.

# Summoner
- Rapid Summons: your minion-summoning spells with a standard action are now swift actions; those that were already swift are free (once/rd).

  - Imp: close burst 5, heavy fire damage plus half ongoing for 3 rds.
  - Succubus: TBD
  - Pixie: close burst 5, allies can choose to teleport anywhere in range that they can see, and they become invisible until they attack or take damage (or until 1 hour passes).

# Minions

Powers such as [Summon Pixie]() grants you the listed minion as a permanent ally.

Although each minion has a &#34;canonical&#34; flavor (e.g. Pixie is Fey, Imp is Infernal), all Invokers can select any minions they choose, and re-flavor as desired. A fey invoker might summon a &#34;redcap&#34; with Imp stats, or a Shadow invoker could summon a &#34;shadow stalker&#34; with Felhunter stats, for example.

Notes on summoning:
- You can only control one summoned minion at a time (summoned via an Invoker spell with &#34;summon&#34; in the title). The exception is Summon Sprites, which does not apply to the limit, nor do other summons apply to that spell's limit.
- Invokers who use Willpower can attempt to control multiple minions at a time. Whenever the number of minions changes, and that number is higher than 1, roll Willpower opposed to Cha save for each minion; on success, they are controlled, and on failure, they run wild.
- Minions have their own HP and Mana pools. When they reach 0 HP, they are immediately unsummoned, and cannot be summoned again for 24 hours, after which they are restored to 100% HP and Mana.
- Minions can take a long rest, either in the prime material plane or when away from you.

The shade now controls the body but doesn’t deprive the target of awareness. The shade can’t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target’s statistics, but doesn’t gain access to the target’s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the shade ends it as a bonus action, or the shade is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the shade reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this shade’s Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.
- Special:
  - Ethereal Sight. The Shade can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.
  - Scan: ranged, swift; determines the physical and metaphysical makeup of the target (level of intelligence, spellcasting, etc).

<bodyHtml>&lt;h1&gt;Invoker&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commonly--and quite inaccurately--named &amp;quot;warlocks&amp;quot;, Invokers are magical practitioners who specialize in invoking the powers of Outer Planes, and of the denizens therein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common misconception is that Invokers have a solitary, unbreakable bond with a single planar overlord. While this arrangement is not unheard of, it rarely results in a long and lucrative career for the Invoker. Anybody can sell their soul--that doesn't make them a Invoker. Instead, the wise Invoker follows the Principle of Equal Exchange, the fundamental law of the Pact. In essence, all Outsiders, regardless of outward appearance or presumed morality, are supernaturally bound to honor contracts and deals, and when a debt is repaid, it is repaid. The devil is, of course, in the details, and thus the true measure of a successful Invoker is whether they can harness the power of Outsiders without becoming hopelessly entrapped by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it is hardly uncommon for a Invoker not to have some sort of debt or kinship he can't easily rid himself of, and this is handled separately. As a rule, Invoker spells and rituals are self-balancing and do not imply permanent debt, while [[#Corruption]] results when a Invoker, wittingly or otherwise, permanently exchanges some sort of debt or bondage in exchange for power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brief version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your primary limiting factor is Corruption, an attribute describing how much your planar powers have corrupted your soul. You gain it by using expensive powers, and reduce it by either purifying yourself or coercing others into accepting some of it. You can gain a lot of power by accepting permanent Corruption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summons: corruption-free, loyal extraplanar minions that you can improve with feats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bindings: permanent or at-will magical abilities that generally don't cause corruption to use, because you already accepted permanent corruption to gain them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invocations: spell-like abilities which generally cause corruption, but are quite powerful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Core skills&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spellcraft (Int): used to conduct invocation rituals, such as summoning, banishing, or commanding extraplanar creatures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concentration (Wis): used to resist Corruption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Willpower (Cha): your ability to command loyalty or otherwise impose your will upon extraplanar creatures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spellcraft
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detect planar alignment: detects extraplanar creatures, portals, extraplanar magical effects. Determine planar origin of same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magic circle: creates a magical barrier for containing extraplanar creatures, or protecting yourself from same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summon outsider: summons an extraplanar creature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Command outsider: subjects an extraplanar creature to your will.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banish outsider: sends an extraplanar creature back to its home plane.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concentration
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resist Corruption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Willpower
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used during Summon, Command, and Banish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determines most abilities of bound minions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Corruption&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimum: 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Threshold: 1/2 level + Wis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below the threshold, Corruption has no in-game effect (but may have several minor cosmetic effects). When at or above the threshold, you must pass Concentration checks each time you gain Corruption, and at certain other times determined by the DM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Concentration check's DC is equal to 10 + your Corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete success: no effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mixed success: you are Tempted, a state the DM can take advantage of at a later time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failure: you are Tainted. At any time, the DM can attempt to compel you into an action you might not have otherwise willed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &amp;quot;Tempted&amp;quot;, the DM can, at an opportune time, offer you a deal on behalf of the planar forces from which you gain power. This must be at a time when your character would be reasonably willing to borrow power for some worthwhile gain. The deal is generally the same as any other action you might have taken: for a given Corruption cost, you gain a certain effect. However, the power can be something you couldn't normally access, or have a powerful enhancement such as using it while you are incapacitated, or as an immediate action, or having empowered effect. In any case, you must pass a Concentration check to resist (you can voluntarily fail if you choose). If you fail the check, you gain 1 (or more, if specified) Corruption, along with the designated benefit. The &amp;quot;Tempted&amp;quot; state disappears, but naturally, you must now roll a fresh Concentration check since you just gained Corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are &amp;quot;Tainted&amp;quot;, the DM can, at any time, attempt to force you to take actions. These actions can be anything, although they will generally serve the purposes of whatever planar source powers you--as opposed to being simply inconvenient or downright hostile to you and your allies. To resist, you must pass a Concentration check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete success: you don't take the action, and instead act however you wish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mixed success: you don't take the action, but you lose your turn, or instead gain 1 Corruption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failure: you take the action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In any case, after the roll and the subsequent action, your Corruption decreases by 1. If it falls below the threshold, you are no longer Tainted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Relieving/Mitigating Corruption&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduce Corruption you have gained is possible, but it takes time. Some of the most reliable ways are to purify yourself with an opposing energy (e.g. prayer or service to a good deity can remove the taint of Infernal power), or to coerce other mortals into service to your planar faction (e.g. tempting mortals to sin please the Infernal plane, rewarding you with reduced Corruption and therfore more agency to continue your great work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In game terms, the above is a &amp;quot;down time&amp;quot; action that generally takes longer than a long rest and only fits into the time between episodes. Many adventurers need a quicker fix than that. There are a few other ways to rid yourself of Corruption, or indeed prevent it before it occurs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soul Shards: shards of mortal souls are the most valuable commodity in every non-prime plane, worth far more than gold or diamonds. Invokers can capture shards of mortal souls--or even souls entire--and place them into tradeable form. Although one cannot promise anything on behalf of another mortal, it is much easier for an outsider to parley with a mortal on their own terms, deep within their plane, then it is on the Prime Material. Thus, soul shards can pay off Corruption, or otherwise purchase Corruption-free power. This is generally not a morally justifiable decision, if you're concerned about that sort of thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contract: by communing with representatives of your planar source, you can enter a contract where you perform some service, in exchange for relief of a given amount of Corruption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transfer: Corruption is a commodity. You accept it into your soul when you willingly choose to. Others can accept it from you, just as they could have accepted it from your planar source. Thus, you can arrange a transfer with any other Invoker, extraplanar creature, deity, or other suitably magical being with its own will, if you can otherwise get them to agree to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Bindings&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bindings do not cost feats or powers. When you accept a binding, you permanently gain its effect, and increase your minimum Corruption by the amount listed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can spend a feat to reduce Corruption cost of a given binding by 1.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Corruption&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Effect&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Armor&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gain a bonus to Armor equal to Cha + 1/2 level. Does not stack with worn armor.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Darkvision&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;You can see in darkness.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fey Step&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Recharge 33%, move; you teleport to a location you can see within walking distance.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Invisibility&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;At-will, swift; you become invisible (+20 Stealth) until you attack or take damage.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Guardian Force&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;At-will, immediate; 50% chance to negate one attack you suffer, max once/rd.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mystic Eyes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;At-will, swift; you see creatures despite concealment, invisibility, or etherealness.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Levitation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gain levitation movement type (same speed as walking, max height = half speed)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Telepathy&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;You can telepathically communicate with creatures who speak a language within range.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Flight&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Replaces Levitation. Gain Fly speed equal to walking speed.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mistform&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;At-will, swift; you become gaseous, gaining a fly speed of 2 squares.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Vampirism&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;When you inflict damage, you heal yourself for 10% of the damage dealt.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;True Seeing&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;You see a telltale outline around all illusion or shape-changing magic, giving it away. The true form thus disguised is revealed to you through the illusion.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detect Thoughts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nondetection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polyglot: 3 mana&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire Shield: 4 mana&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Antimagic Field: 8 mana&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empty Mind: 8 mana&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foresight: 9 mana&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Rituals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are magical effects that any Invoker can attempt. You need not spend Powers or Feats to gain access to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short list, to be fleshed out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magic Circle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summon Outsider&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Command Outsider&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banish Outsider (thrice and done)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plane Shift&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create Demiplane
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expand Demiplane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shift to/from Demiplane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create Denizens of Demiplane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planar Cache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vergence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create Soul Gem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curse of Souls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soulgaze&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Invocations&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Invocation requires a Power to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;General&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curse: varying corruption costs. Ideas:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tongues
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0: speak gibberish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1: speak as I command (spell conduit?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weakness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agony&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Woe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Souls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feat ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curse Pestilence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Fey&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summon Sprite: 0 corruption, at-will, swift; summons a sprite, with 1 hp/level, Dodge 10 + spellcasting bonus, that inflicts light damage with a melee attack and can fly 6 squares/rd.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sprite options: fire sprite, frost sprite, wind sprite (lightning damage).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sacrifice: if you have this ability, you can cause sprites to explode, inflicting double normal damage in a burst 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple Sprites: you can command multiple sprites at a time (max 1 per Invocation rank), this is separate from your ability to command other minions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Color&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Color Spray: at-will, std; you create a blast of vivid colors, all across the spectrum. Inflicts damage and debilitation based on color choice. For 1 Corruption, you can target a creature within range; for 2 Corruption, you create a cone 3.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red: medium fire damage plus half ongoing for 3 rds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yellow: medium lightning damage plus stunned 1 rd (Fort neg).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blue: medium frost damage plus chilled (Fort ends).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Green: medium poison damage plus weakened (Fort ends).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orange: medium acid damage plus acid burn (worn items must pass Fort save or be destroyed; natural armor reduced by 4).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purple: medium psychic damage plus confused (Will ends).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White: medium arcane damage plus dispel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black: medium necrotic damage plus cannot be healed (Will ends).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0 Corruption: one color, one target, light damage instead of medium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Color Veil: 1 Corruption, at-will, std, wall 1/level within range; you create a 20-ft high wall of a single, translucent color. It does not block line of sight, and only blocks line of effect for specific effects per color choice (whether mundane or magical):
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red: projectile weapons and missiles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yellow: fluid effects including breath weapons (but not natural floods).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blue: TBD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Green: extradimensional effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orange: hostile transmutations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purple: mental effects and divinations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White: dispelling, antimagic fields, force effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black: death and negative energy effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Color Pool: 1 Corruption, at-will, swift, 1 square within range; colored square imparts boon upon allies as soon as they enter, cross through, or start a turn in the square, lasting 3 rds after leaving it. Color choices:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red: bonus damage die with all attacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yellow: +50% movement, advantage to Reflex checks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blue: ablation 10%, 1 charge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Green: Fast Healing 10%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orange: TBD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purple: TBD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White: TBD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black: TBD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discolor: removes the ability of target to use certain kinds of magic.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red: energy attacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purple: mental effects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White: dispels, counters, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future enhancements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prism Power: single color effect has all 7 effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talent to add +1 color to each effect? Or that happens naturally by tier?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mischief&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legerdemain: invisible fairies manipulate things at range with the strength and dexterity of an average humanoid. Capable of picking locks, opening/closing doors, operating switches, disarming traps, all using your own skills. Costs no Corruption if you devote your action to guiding them. Also:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Corruption: fairies steal a held item from target and deliver it to you or other location within range (Reflex negates)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 Corruption: fairies remove all worn/held items from target, delivering them to location within range (Reflex negates each item)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sensation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glamour: you change your appearance at will, either disguising your identity, or decorating yourself to appear more comely.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0 corruption: change apparent identity to another member of same creature type and size (i.e. medium humanoid)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 corruption: change type, or size within 1 category. Effect is illusionary (Will disbelieves, but otherwise damage is real and psychic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 corruption: targets not in combat are fascinated by you (Will ends, ends if they take damage or you attack)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 corruption per target: appearance creates emotional effect, such as charm, unwillingness to harm you, belief you are in a position to give orders, etc. Will ends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magic Fingers: at-will, touch, 1 Corruption; you cause subject to experience any physical sensation you can imagine, within their mental capabilities. Generally, this causes subject to be stunned while active (Will ends).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phantom Music: at-will, emanation; you produce music or otherwise musical sounds.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0 corruption: any mundane sound or music.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 corruption: music or sound that inspires powerful emotions, such as:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Courage: allies gain Fast Healing 10%, +50% movement, and advantage to loss-of-control effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intimidation: enemies suffer disadvantage to attack rolls (until one is successful), and must pass Will saves each time they are damaged by you or allies, lest they become frightened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more tbd&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eyebite?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wonder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jubilation: burst of arcane power that can damage foes. When interacting with magic or magical beings, unpredictably creates magical effects including firing off spells and powers the target has access to, dispelling or transforming active duration effects, or causing wild surges. Replaces the old &lt;strong&gt;Wonder&lt;/strong&gt; spell.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0 Corruption: at-will, std, ranged; light arcane damage plus minor effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1+ Corruption: TBI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideation: creates a figment of light, sound, smell, etc, that does not interact.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 corruption: those who fail (Wis disbelieves) can interact with it, including taking damage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spellmorph&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Trap card&amp;quot;: place on spellcaster, if they use a specific effect, bad news.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Infernal&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;General&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sin Sight: you see the sins of the target. TBD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bindings:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire Resistant: 1 corruption. Resist 50% to fire damage, remainder is subdual. For 2 corruption, immune to fire. For 3 corruption, fire damage heals you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chaos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anarchy: causes subjects to rebel against their overlords.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hellball:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hellfire&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immolate: set subject on fire. Can focus your action to intensify the burn, or spread it to others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Haunt: summon spectres of those the subject has wronged, who harass and enervate the target.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal Purgatory: forces subject to relive their worst sins, from the perspective of those they've wronged. Compels Ebject to repent, or else causes mental ability damage, all while debilitating/disabling them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Temptation: compels enemies to sin, potentially causing conflict among their ranks. Alternatively, grants allies a powerful buff, but they all gain Corruption. Examples:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avarice: maximize treasure die rolls, increase profit margins of buying/selling, add bonus treasure rolls, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Envy: gain an additional power or feat you could normally select, for the rest of the encounter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pride: gain advantage to all checks for the encounter; lost as soon as you fail once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sloth: instantly gain the benefit of a short rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrath: bonus die of damage to all attacks for the encounter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Suffering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chains of Suffering: fiendish, barbed chains restrict enemy's movements, cause harm, deflect attacks, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curse of Agony: subject is wracked with pain, unable to take actions. This can be conditional at your option, allowing you to compel certain behaviors on pain of...well, pain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unknown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make someone see demons/etc instead of normal life, so that they freak out and do bad things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Shadow&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special mechanics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can conjure Forbidden Knowledge, gaining new invocations/feats at the cost of sanity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curse of Doom: puts the Final Destination curse on someone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;Summon Shadow&lt;/a&gt;: Ranged; you summon a literal shadow--a two-dimensional projection of darkness that exists on walls, floors, etc. It is silent, and can't interact with the three-dimensional world, but makes a good spy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;Summon Voidwalker&lt;/a&gt;: Ranged; you summon a hulking brute made of darkness that protects you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;Summon Shade&lt;/a&gt;: Ranged; you summon an incorporeal shadow that can possess mortals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shadow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;Shadowstuff&lt;/a&gt;: You make stuff out of shadow. TBI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;Wall of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;: At-will, std, wall 1/level, concentration; 20-ft high wall of total darkness blocks line of sight and line of effect for spells. Anything crossing it suffers medium necrotic damage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;Shadow Double&lt;/a&gt;: At-will, swift, ranged, concentration; you create a shadowy double of yourself or a chosen subject. The double is under your control, and has the same physical abilities as the subject. You can cast spells through the double, using your own actions, mana, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;Shadow Walk&lt;/a&gt;: You can shift in and out of the Shadow Realm. TBI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Darkness&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Absorb Light&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Madness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Drain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;Drain Life&lt;/a&gt;: at-will, std, ranged; medium necrotic damage, plus you heal yourself the same amount. Overheal becomes temporary HP (expires at the end of the encounter, max value is 100% of max HP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;Drain Mana&lt;/a&gt;: at-will, std, ranged; you drain 1d3+1 Mana from subject (if they have it), gaining the same as temporary Mana (expires at the end of the encounter). For every 5 levels of Invoker, gain +1 bonus drain and +1 die type (d3-&amp;gt;d4-&amp;gt;d6-&amp;gt;etc).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;Drain Soul&lt;/a&gt;: at-will, std, ranged; you extract a portion of the subject's soul, forming it into a glowing, black crystal called a Soul Shard. Subject suffers 1 level of enervation (-1 to all checks, disabled if enervation levels &amp;gt; hit dice). Choose one of the following:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fetish: you drain one of the subject's ability scores. They suffer a -4 penalty to that score while the soul shard exists, and you gain +4 to the same score. Lasts up to 24 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phylactery: you use the soul fragment as the component for a phylactery (see &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;Create Phylactery&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steal Ability: you gain access to a single chosen power, maneuver, or skill that the subject possesses, while you retain the shard. Lasts up to 24 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Void&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;Star of the Void&lt;/a&gt;: At-will, std, ranged; you summon a mote of pure void that annihilates anything it touches. Each round that you spend an action to control it, it moves as you desire, flying up to 10 squares and attacking one target (optionally). Target suffers heavy disintegration damage on contact (Reflex half). If you do not spend an action to control it, it acts however it wants (use the &lt;em&gt;Confusion&lt;/em&gt; rules). To end the spell, you must spend an action to send it away. Anyone else with knowledge of this spell can contest your will for control of the Star.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;Disintegrate&lt;/a&gt;: At-will, std, ranged; heavy disintegration damage (Fort half).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;Void Shield&lt;/a&gt;: At-will, swift, concentration; you &amp;quot;wield&amp;quot; a disc of absolute blackness. As a reaction, you can absorb any incoming targeted effect. Spells and projectiles are annihilated on contact. Melee attackers can roll Reflex to pull back their attack; if they fail to do so, their weapon is annihilated. Unarmed attackers get a similar save to avoid heavy disintegration damage. Magic items get a Willpower save to avoid destruction. This spell is probably OP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;Hungering Void&lt;/a&gt;: At-will, std, ranged, 1 square; you tear open a hole in reality, sucking everything toward it, and ejecting whatever falls into it into deepest night. This spell is super OP and I have to figure out how to balance it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Feats&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time you select one of the below feats, you also gain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+1 HP/level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+1 Spellcraft, Concentration, Willpower&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+0.5 Fortitude, Reflex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Spell Enhancements&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mirror Image: modifies &lt;em&gt;Veil&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rainbow Beam: modifies &lt;em&gt;Color Spray&lt;/em&gt;. Area changes to line 20x1 or 10x2. Each target is hit with a chosen color (can be different for each target).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greater Sprites: modifies &lt;em&gt;Summon Sprite&lt;/em&gt;. Existing sprites are enhanced, and new options added:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire sprite: light fire damage plus half ongoing 3 rds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frost sprite: light frost damage plus chilled (Fort ends).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wind sprite: light lightning damage plus same if subject leaves their square in the next 1 rd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brain sprite: light psychic damage plus confusion (Will ends).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arcane sprite: light arcane damage, or a dispel attempt. On sacrifice, dispel all instances of a spell in a burst 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Death sprite: light necrotic damage plus Resist 50% (healing) for 3 rds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Bladebound&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bound Arms: at-will, swift; you &amp;quot;summon&amp;quot; one of your minions, but rather than giving them an independent form, you bind them into the shape of a weapon, or into the form of an existing weapon. In the former case, the weapon's stats are equal to a normal martial weapon you are proficient with.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imp: adds medium fire damage, plus light fire ongoing for 3 rds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pixie: can put enemies to sleep, or adds +10 critical threat range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Succubus: adds medium necrotic damage, can entangle and wrack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fusion: at-will, swift; you &amp;quot;summon&amp;quot; one of your minions, but rather than giving them an independent form, you bind them into the shape of armor, or into the form of your existing armor. In the former case, the armor's stats are equal to a normal armor type you are proficient with. Examples:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voidwalker: Absorb 50% (any), limit medium damage each round. Resist shadow/necrotic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Armiger: summon a bunch of weapons at once, costs Corruption, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Summoner&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rapid Summons: your minion-summoning spells with a standard action are now swift actions; those that were already swift are free (once/rd).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soul Link: when a minion is within range, half the damage you suffer is transferred to them. Any death or loss-of-control effect you suffer has a 50% chance of transferring to the minion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sacrifice: at-will, reaction; you sacrifice an active minion, expending them as if they reached 0 HP, but producing a powerful effect:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imp: close burst 5, heavy fire damage plus half ongoing for 3 rds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Succubus: TBD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pixie: close burst 5, allies can choose to teleport anywhere in range that they can see, and they become invisible until they attack or take damage (or until 1 hour passes).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Felhunter: close burst 5, dispel attempt against a chosen effect on each target, or dispel attempt against each effect on one target. Allies gain Resist 50% (magic) for 2 rounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voidwalker: close burst 5, allies gain Absorb 100% (all, limit Voidwalker's max HP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sprite: close burst 2, same effect as a normal attack, but double damagee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evolution: advances your minion to a more powerful form. Examples:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Void Knight: has Pound, Gravity, Shadowy Shield.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethereal: more powerful shade that has enhanced abilities while ethereal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sylph: pixie that can heal you, put enemies to sleep, aura grants allies bonus movement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dread Stalker: more deadly felhunter. Has cool dredlocks. Has Phase Shift, Shadow Tunnel, grants allies magic detection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minion Resilience: your Minions gain 2 HP/level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share Senses: you gain your minions' extra senses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Minions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powers such as &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;Summon Pixie&lt;/a&gt; grants you the listed minion as a permanent ally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although each minion has a &amp;quot;canonical&amp;quot; flavor (e.g. Pixie is Fey, Imp is Infernal), all Invokers can select any minions they choose, and re-flavor as desired. A fey invoker might summon a &amp;quot;redcap&amp;quot; with Imp stats, or a Shadow invoker could summon a &amp;quot;shadow stalker&amp;quot; with Felhunter stats, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes on summoning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can only control one summoned minion at a time (summoned via an Invoker spell with &amp;quot;summon&amp;quot; in the title). The exception is Summon Sprites, which does not apply to the limit, nor do other summons apply to that spell's limit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invokers who use Willpower can attempt to control multiple minions at a time. Whenever the number of minions changes, and that number is higher than 1, roll Willpower opposed to Cha save for each minion; on success, they are controlled, and on failure, they run wild.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minions have their own HP and Mana pools. When they reach 0 HP, they are immediately unsummoned, and cannot be summoned again for 24 hours, after which they are restored to 100% HP and Mana.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minions can take a long rest, either in the prime material plane or when away from you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Pixie&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability scores: her Dex and Cha = your Int/Wis/Cha (whichever is highest), others are 0&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Pixie Dust: can cause a single target to laugh or sneeze uncontrollably (Con ends), or similar usage of dust (e.g. drug trips).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Evolution: Sylph&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+2 HP/level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Healing Dust: recharge 33%, swift, touch; heals subject for medium damage.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability scores: Str and Con = your Int/Wis/Cha (whichever is highest), Dex and Wis are half that, Int and Cha 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saves: Str, Con&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size: medium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movement: walk 6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AC: 10 + Dex + proficiency bonus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HP: 2 per level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attacks:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bite: std, melee, Str vs AC; light piercing damage, plus one special:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spell Lock: next spell subject casts, they must pass a Concentration check against the damage of the bite in order not to lose the spell. Lasts 3 rounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Devour Magic: dispels one spell on the subject (opposed skill checks).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Devour Mana: drains 1 Mana or an equivalent spell slot. At Invoker rank 2, drains 2 Mana, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+2 HP/level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shadow Tunnel: recharge 33%, swift; creates a portal at current location and another within range. For 1 rd, any creatures of medium size or smaller can use the portals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magic Hunter: emanation 10; allies gain the ability to detect magic, blindsense for the location of active spells and spellcasters, and advantage to one save vs. magic each round.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Steal Spell: when dispelling, steal the effect if possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Treant&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Emanation 3, area is difficult terrain for enemies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Voidwalker&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability scores: Str and Con = your highest mental stat, Dex and Int = half that, Wis and Cha 0&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Defenses:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resist shadow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attacks:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slam: one attack per Invoker rank, melee, std; medium bludgeoning damage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Special:

&lt;li&gt;DCs: 8 + your proficiency + Shade's Int&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size: medium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movement: fly 6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AC 10 + Dex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HP: 1 per level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defenses:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resist shadow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No anatomy: immune to disease and poison&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorporeal: immune to all nonmagical physical effects except force damage, resistance to magical effects from the material plane&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Chill touch: std, melee, Dex vs AC: light necrotic damage, plus target cannot regain HP until the start of next turn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possession (Recharge 6). One humanoid that the shade can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the shade; the shade then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The shade now controls the body but doesn’t deprive the target of awareness. The shade can’t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target’s statistics, but doesn’t gain access to the target’s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the shade ends it as a bonus action, or the shade is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the shade reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this shade’s Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Special:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethereal Sight. The Shade can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan: ranged, swift; determines the physical and metaphysical makeup of the target (level of intelligence, spellcasting, etc).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Variant: Spirit of Intellect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace Chill Touch with Steal Knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Nightmare&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;http://5e.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/nightmare.htm&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Astral Steed (variant)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Str +4 Dex +2 Con +3 Int +0 Wis +1 Cha +5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walk 60-ft, Fly 90-ft&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HP 2 per level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defenses:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immune to color-based magic&lt;/li&gt;
