# Powers

# Biometabolism
- [Healing Factor]()
1         | Biometabolism    | Camouflage           | At-will, swift, conc; gain advantage to Stealth checks, and your identity cannot be determined.
3         | Biometabolism    | Invisibility         | At-will, swift, conc; invisible while still, +20 to Stealth otherwise, breaks on attack or damage.


# Psychoportation

1         | Psychoportation  | Blink                | Recharge 33%, move; you instantly move up to your movement speed. Not teleportation; it must be possible to traverse the distance without this effect, although gravity does not apply, and movement does not provoke.
1         | Psychoportation  | Hex Portal           | At-will, swift, conc; portal in your square is linked to a movable portal within range.
5         | Psychoportation  | Dimension Door       | Encounter, swift, conc; portal within range leads to another portal within 1 mile/level.
5         | Psychoportation  | Recall               | Encounter, reaction; you reset your state (all attributes, position, etc) to that of the beginning of the current round, although the effects of your actions are not undone.
9         | Psychoportation  | Sling Ring           | Encounter, std, conc, 2 Int strain; portal leads to anywhere on the same planet.
9         | Psychoportation  | Warp Bubble          | Encounter, reaction, centered circle 0-3, concentration; all ranged attacks crossing the bubble are redirected to a random outward direction. Crossing through the bubble requires a Strength check against your DC (fail: cannot cross; success: effect ends).




# Psychokinesis

## Autokinesis
- [Absorb Force](): At-will, reaction to incoming kinetic damage; you absorb up to a medium damage roll, suffering the rest (if any). Tally all damage absorbed; it can be added as you choose to your own kinetic attacks.
- [Rocket Punch](): At-will, std; you move in a straight line for 10 squares or until you strike an unyielding surface; anyone in your path suffers medium kinetic damage plus push 10. If they strike an unyielding surface, they instead suffer heavy damage.
- [Shield Conversion](): Whenever you inflict physical damage, gain 10% of the damage you inflict to a damage shield (Absorb 100% (physical)), lasting the encounter.

## Telekinesis
1         | Psychokinesis    | Telekinesis          | At-will, swift, conc, ranged; grab an item you could lift if your Cha were Str. Thereafter, std action to move, slide 5, or push 5 plus medium damage, the latter ending the effect.
1         | Psychokinesis    | Absorb Force         | At-will, reaction; absorb up to medium damage from incoming kinetic attack. Tally all damage absorbed; you can add any or all of this damage to a kinetic attack within the encounter.
