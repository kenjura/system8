<article><name>Mana and Metamagic</name>
<contents>Instead of tracking mana for every spell ever, we will design most powers to essential contain their own cantrips and mana-costing effects. These heightened effects, in addition to standard metamagic (widen, enlarge, etc), are the only things that cost mana.

Mana itself will be a much smaller amount, determined mostly by Concentration and Wisdom, replenishing with short rest.

What you can do with metamagic is determined by Spellcraft and power knowledge.

Thus:

Spellcraft:
- rank 1: widen, enlarge, extend, silent, still
- rank 2: maximize, chain, quicken
- rank 3: contingent, permanent

Concentration
- rank 1
  - suspend spell: 1 mana, concentration spell no longer requires concentration, instead lasts a certain time (TBD), although it can't be actively controlled while you aren't concentrating on it
- rank 2
  - reserve spell: X mana, concentration spell goes into dormant state on target. You or target can activate it as a free action at a later time.

Mana:
- max value = concentration rank + wis bonus
- want more? each skill has options (e.g. Invocation-&gt;Corruption, Arcana-&gt;spell foci, Thaumaturgy-&gt;Vitae)


Sample powers:
- Summon Sprite: 0 mana, swift, summons a sprite. Can control up to 1 sprite per 4 levels. For +1 mana, summons another sprite (doesn't change max).
- Color Spray: 0 mana, one target, chosen color. +1 mana = cone 3. +1 mana = extra color.
- Color Veil: 0 mana, wall 1/Wis, one color effect. +1 mana = +100% wall length, +1 mana = +1 color.
- Legerdemain: 0 mana, faeries steal one item. +1 mana = all worn items. +1 mana = all held items.
- Time Hop: 0 mana, one target hops forward in time 1d4 rounds. +1 mana = +1d4 rounds. +1 mana = +1 radius.
