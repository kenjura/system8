[{"name":"Future Tech","contents":"\n\n# Phones\n\nIssued at level 1.\n\nEveryone is issued a standard galactic phone. This works similarly to an early 21st century standard flagship phone, with the following differences:\n- The device is extremely resilient (hardness 50, hp 500)\n- The battery lasts forever with no recharging (although it does detect as mildly radioactive)\n- The phone gets a 10 Gbps signal anywhere in the known universe. It is equipped with all known terrestrial and alien encoding protocols to allow hacking of other devices\n- It is coupled with an implant that allows only you to see, hear, and make sense of its outputs. Apart from you, it is a useless brick. The implant also tells you the bearing and direction of the phone at all times, and allows you to remotely detonate it if necessary.\n- In addition to GPS and GLONASS, it has the ability to find its location in space and time almost anywhere in the Universe, as long as the local laws of physics are working correctly.\n- It comes coupled with standard Black Sunglasses, which are of course high-end AR lenses.\n- Axiom is tracking your every move, all the time. Of course.\n\n\n# Apps\n\n## Free Apps\n\n### Face ID\nPoint the phone (or your glasses) at a face, issue a command, and get an ID and full dossier in about a second. Name, address, phone number, employer, salary, blood type, registered voting party, bust size, etc.\n\n## Badge-on-Demand\nProduces a number of digital badges identifying you as a government or law enforcement officer, including:\n- Department of Homeland Security Auxiliary Deputy: useful for interfacing with local and state PDs, the FBI, etc\n- National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, Department 3: surprisingly useful for gaining access to national and state parks, covert extraterrestrial observation posts, and certain military bases\n- Nevada Gaming Commission warrant officer: near unlimited access to any casino, tourist attraction, or \"off-the-books\" gaming facility.\n\n## Petty Cash\nInterfaces with all known digital payment solutions, point-of-sale devices, and ATMs, withdrawn from company funds. The Director will know exactly how much you spent.\n\n## PRISM\nStandard NSA PRISM gateway. Once authenticated, allows you to search records from all compliant internet service providers, corporate databases, and of course government records. Can be used to hack any wireless device (or wired device, using the retractable multi-connector, if close enough), but you still need a Hacking skill to do so.\n\nNo relation to the officer designated \"Prism\".\n\n## Amazon Drone Delivery\nNeed a toaster? A complete 7-disc set of Buffy the Vampire Slayer on Blu-Ray? A package of hot dogs? A loaded AR-15<sup>1</sup>? Amazon Drone Delivery will have your package delivered to your current location<sup>2</sup> (or a desired address) within 30 minutes or...well, there's no penalty if they miss the window, but they usually don't. Axiom members get complementary Rush Service, enjoying a 3d6 minute delivery window within major metropolitan areas!\n\nFootnotes:\n- 1: firearms, recreational drugs, and other hazardous items are prohibited by federal law from delivery via drone, except in the state of Nevada.\n- 2: service is currently only provided on Earth within 15 kilometers of an Amazon drone facility, or on the secret Martian colony that only rich people have access to.\n\n## Pandora\nSiri? Alexa? Cortana? Forget those dinosaurs. Pandora is your state-of-the-art, quantum-computer-based AI assistant. She's smarter than 95% of the humans you've ever met, and knows everything that humanity has ever known. She's ready to assist you at a moment's notice, because she's always listening. And watching. And judging.\n\n## BABEL\nThe BABEL program represents the latest in neuro-linguistic brainwave interface. Rather than muck about with speech-to-text and natural language processing, BABEL simply scans the brain waves of whoever is talking to immediately translate any alien language, including cultural connotations and other context computers just can't hack. Oh, and you don't even need to know the language--BABEL will figure it out in real time, with only a small amount of hilarious mis-translation in the first few, tense moments of First Contact. 99% quality guaranteed!\n\nOnly intelligent minds produce such brain waves, so don't go trying to talk to your goldfish with this (although dolphins might have a thing or two to say).\n\nFor recorded video and audio, brainwave scans are no good, but BABEL can still fall back on a hyper-core quantum processor to make its best guess using NLP for known languages.\n\n\n# Paid Apps\n\nAvailable to requisition using your Axiom Credit Rating!\n\n\n## Neuralizer (1,000 CR)\nUsing what appears to be an ordinary flash for photography, your phone emits a series of extremely rapid pulses of complex electromagnetic radiation, which, when transmitted to the human brain through optic nerves, cause disruption to the hippocampus, effectively wiping out the last 20-30 seconds. For a brief period thereafter, subjects are highly suggestible as to what, in fact, they have just experienced (disadvantage to any relevant saves). This can be disorienting, but has been shown to be mostly harmless in various longitudinal tests.\n\nNote: for longer-term memory modification, a more powerful app is required.\n\n## Memory Patcher (4,000 CR)\nUsing similar light pulses to the Neuralizer, but lasting much longer (at least 3 rounds, see description), the Memory Patcher induces a much deeper state of suggestibility, allowing you to guide the target through the process of rewriting memories to an arbitrary depth.\n\nAt-will, std, range 1; subject is stunned (Wis negates). If they fail three saves within 1 minute, they become helpless and highly suggestible. You may then reprogram their memories (assuming you have a shared language). Roll Int to reprogram:\n- Last few hours: DC 10\n- A single thread of memory for the last few days (e.g. sighting a specific strange creature): DC 15\n- Experiences along a single thread going back into the depths of long-term memory: DC 20\n- If multiple threads, you must repeat the process.\n- Failing by 1 or more causes mental damage to the target (DM discretion). Failing by 10 or more additionally causes the memory alteration to fail.\n- It is possible to learn proficiency in this tool.\n\n## Stun Setting (2,000 CR)\nUsing the \"flash\" of your phone, you can emit a pulse of light that stuns humanoids, beasts, and generally anything with eyes and central nervous system.\n\n- Recharge 33%, std, short range; target is stunned (Con ends).\n\nGreater stun setting (costs 10,000 CR):\n- At-will, std, short range; target is stunned (Con ends).\n- Recharge 33%, std, cone 3; targets are stunned (Con ends).\n\n## Bio-Scanner (1,000 CR)\nUsing the \"camera\" array, the phone can scan a humanoid, animal, or known extraterrestrial inside and out, delivering a comprehensive medical report in just under 3 seconds.\n\n## Clone Scanner (2,000 CR)\nUpgrade to the Bio-Scanner. Once scanned, you can request that Axiom Cloning Labs generate a clone of the creature. While active, the clone costs ACR based on its effectiveness (i.e. CR). It can be programmed to act like the target (using information from the bio-scanner, PRISM, etc; i.e. using Deception), and/or can be modified as you please.\n\nClones take 24 hours to grow, but rush orders can be requested for 2 hour delivery with the Director's approval.\n\n## Thermal Ray (4,000 CR)\nA small emitter in the \"earpiece\" end of the phone can emit a phaser-like beam of energy. \n- At-will, std, short range; beam can cut as effectively as a plasma cutter.\n- At-will, std, ranged; heavy fire damage.\n\n## Inventory Screen (2,000 CR+)\nAn app that shows you all items you've stored in your Axiom Near-Dimensional Adjunct Space. By default, that space is a 3m x 3m x 3m room (climate controlled, standard earth atmosphere, about the size of a standard storage unit or half a one-car garage), with a max of 20 objects. As a bonus action, you can store one held item or retrieve one item. Items transition in and out of the Adjunct Space in a digitization process.\n\nUpgrades:\n- 10x10x5 room, 100 objects, approx 1.5 car garage, transfer up to 3 items at a time: 5,000 CR\n- 50x50x10 warehouse, 1000 objects, transfer any items within circle 5: 10,000 CR\n\n## Wormhole Beacon (5,000 CR)\nThe ultimate ride-hailing app, this creates a beacon for a Hyperspace Conduit generator and notifies Dispatch of your requirements. Within 2d6 rounds, a wormhole will appear, allowing transit of anything that can fit through its 2m aperture back to the high-security Staging Area in an undisclosed location, whereby, after passing necessary security screening and decontamination, you can be routed back to Axiom HQ. Emergency transport is possible with Director approval.\n\nUpgrades:\n- Point-to-point capability: from anywhere to anywhere (that you also have a beacon). 10,000 CR\n- 5m aperture: Add 5,000 CR\n\n## Phototemporal Displacement Engine (4,000 CR)\nUsing the camera and screen in your phone or AR glasses, this device allows you to \"rewind time\", showing you what whatever is in the field of view of your camera (and within 100 meters of its lens) would have looked like within a specified time in the past (any time from Jan 1 1970 CE to the present day). \n\nNote: this is not guaranteed to be accurate, as it involves highly complex quantum calculations to predict physical phenomena. The further back you go, the more inaccurate it is. Similarly, since it is prediction based, it can also attempt to predict the future. This can be...extremely inaccurate...depending on what you're looking at.\n\n## Weather Channel (4,000 CR)\nProvides a wealth of historical data, precise current weather, and extremely accurate predictions going out several years, for any location in the known universe.\n\nMore importantly, it can change the weather. Just click \"edit\", select the desired weather from the dropdown, drag the sliders around, and click \"commit\". Then wait 1d4 x 10 minutes.\n\n## Hologram Generator (2,000 CR+)\nUsing the \"flash\" array, your phone can generate holograms that you can program (or describe to Pandora) to do whatever you want, as long as they fit within a circle 2 and are made entirely of light.\n\nYes, this can be configured as a glamer, as long as the hologram is your size or larger.\n\nUpgrades:\n- Auditory: +1,000 CR (act now to receive Olfactory at no extra charge!)\n- Hard Light: +2,000 CR (holograms can be \"felt\" kind of like haptic feedback; much more believable when touched, but still not \"real\")\n\n## Night-Night Ray (2,000 CR)\nUsing flashing light pulses, your phone causes humanoids, animals, and known extreterrestrials (prone to such things) to become very sleepy, and immediately full unconscious. Only works if they are not already in an agitated state (i.e. alerted to danger).\n\nRecharge 33%, cone 3; subjects fall asleep on a failed Con save. On success, they become sleepy (disadvantage to checks) until they pass another Con save. Alerting subject to danger ends all effects caused by this ray. Otherwise, they will sleep as dictated by their natural rhythyms, at minimum 90 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n# Vehicles\n\n\n# Ground Vehicle Upgrade\n\n## Convenient Optical Pretense (C.O.P) (1,000 CR)\nOptical camouflage system allows your vehicle to appear to be any other vehicle, including an emergency vehicle with valid markings, sirens, lights, etc.\n\n## Unopinionated Tires (2,000 CR)\nMost tires are so opinionated as to which way is \"down\". How droll. These tires could care less. Want to drive on walls? Ceilings? Sure! Just twist the knob to let the tires know. Also, to make things simpler, these tires never directly contact any surface, but cling to a point in space a few millimeters over the average surface grade, which always affords optimal traction in all driving conditions (such as driving up a glass skyscraper, in the rain).\n\n## Grappling Hook (1,000 CR)\nPretty much what the name suggests.\n\n## Bullet-Proof Armor (2,000 CR)\nGrants the vehicle an Armor rating of 20 and hardness 20. Glass is replaced with transparent alloys.\n\n## Weapon Mount (weapon cost)\nCan mount a vehicle-sized weapon such as a 50mm machine gun or rocket launcher, or several personal-sized weapons. Turrets can be AI or manually operated.\n\n\n# Weapons and Tools\n\n\n# Tools\n\n## Plasma Cutter (500 CR)\nA knife-sized blade with a plasma edge, capable of cutting through almost anything.\n\nWeapon stats: one-hand, light, medium thermal, 18/x2.\n\n\n# Military Grade Weapons\n\nWeapon          | CR     | Range      | Damage                  | Critical | Ammo Capacity / Reload   | Special\n----------------|--------|------------|-------------------------|----------| -------------------------|--------\nAssault Rifle   | 1,000  | long range | heavy kinetic           | 19/x3    | 30, bonus/move           | Full Auto, Burst Fire, Semi Auto\nSniper Rifle    | 1,000  | extreme    | heavy kinetic           | 19/x3    | 6, std                   | Semi Auto, Sniper\nRocket Launcher | 2,000  | propelled  | heavy explosive burst 3 | 20/x2    | 1, move                  | Guided\nLaser Pistol    | 1,000  | medium     | medium thermal          | 18/x2    | 20, move                 | Armor Piercing\nLaser Rifle     | 2,000  | long       | heavy thermal           | 18/x2    | 30, move                 | Armor Piercing\nPlasma Sword    | 1,000  | melee      | heavy thermal           | 19/x3    |                          | Armor Piercing, cuts through anything\nMaser           | 1,000  | medium     | medium EM (subdual)     | 18/x2    |                          | Stuns bio and robot targets\n\nSpecials:\n- Semi Auto: no action to reload between shots, even multiple times per round. May be a reload action for a magazine.\n- Burst Fire: as Semi-Auto, but fires 3 rounds per tap. Grants advantage to hit, but does normal damage (on crit, does two additional dice).\n- Full Auto: fires entire magazine in a standard action. Either:\n  - Single target: advantage to hit. For each point above target's AC that you hit, inflict a bonus die of damage.\n  - Sweeping Fire: fires in a cone to extent of range, disadvantage to hit, normal damage.\n- Sniper: if you establish a proper firing position (standard action, immobilizes you), then the Aim action adds +5 to threat range, stacking up to 3 times.\n- Propelled: a propelled projectile flies on its own. By default, it is long range, but it can continue flying well beyond long range, up to one mile (or more if noted). The odds of hitting anything beyond long range cut in half for every 100m or 300 ft, unless guided.\n- Guided: using the Aim action, you can establish a lock. A propelled projectile will guide itself toward the target, granting a +10 bonus to hit.\n- Armor Piercing: ignores armor meant to deflect kinetic damage (most armor on vehicles, structures, and personnel).\n\n\n# Vehicle-size Weapons\nRequires a tripod or car-sized vehicle mount.\n\nWeapon           | CR     | Range      | Damage                     | Critical | Ammo Capacity / Reload   | Special\n-----------------|--------|------------|----------------------------|----------|--------------------------|--------\n50mm Machine Gun | 5,000  | long       | heavy kinetic (x2)         | 19/x3    | 500, std                 | Full Auto\nMissile Launcher | 10,000 | propelled  | heavy explosive burst 5 x2 | 20/x2    | 2, std each              | Guided\n\nTo do:\n- Ammo types for MG, including incendiary, explosive, etc\n\n\n\n\n# Biotech\n\nBrainstorming:\n- Sleep removal\n- Muscle controller\n- Subdermal nano-armor\n- Healing factor\n- Adult supervision\n- In-brain WiFi\n- Neural filter (pain suppression, mental protection, etc)\n- Hyper immunity (poison/disease/drug resist)\n- Stat adds (use s6 gem color system)\n- Fing-longer\n- Yerkes-Dodson Optimizer\n- Artificial Blood Infuser (Sevika's shimmer pump)\n\n\n\n# Implants\n\nThere are three biological systems these implants can interface with. Each system can only safely have one implant applied to it:\n- Psychometabolic System: the system that provides \"power\" to the nervous sytem. While not centralized, it can be augmented, routing additional power where needed.\n- Cerebromotor System: the system that interlinks the CNS with skeletal muscle. Controls reaction speed, reflex, and quickness of wit.\n- Neuroregenerative System: the system that allows the CNS to regulate itself, and, in some cases, regeneration. \n\nThese basal implants provide a certain baseline benefit, but primarily act as an interface for artificial implants that enhance specific functionality.\n\nBaseline benefit grants 2 bonus attribute points to be divided as you wish between 2 candidate attributes. For instance, a psychometabolic implant might grant 4 points to Str/Cha, allowing you to select +2 to each, +4 to one and +0 to the other, +3/+1, etc. To adjust this ratio, please see an Axiom Implant Specialist.\n\nBasal Implant                     | CR     | Baseline Benefit     | Enhancement Slots\n----------------------------------|--------|----------------------|------------------\nPsychometabolic Implant, rank 1   | 1,000  | 2 points, Str/Cha    | 1\nPsychometabolic Implant, rank 2   | 3,000  | 4 points, Str/Cha    | 2\nPsychometabolic Implant, rank 3   | 6,000  | 6 points, Str/Cha    | 3\nPsychometabolic Implant, rank 4   | 10,000 | 8 points, Str/Cha    | 4\nPsychometabolic Implant, rank 5   | 20,000 | 10 points, Str/Cha   | 5\nCerebromotor Implant, rank 1      | 1,000  | 2 points, Dex/Int    | 1\nCerebromotor Implant, rank 2      | 3,000  | 4 points, Dex/Int    | 2\nCerebromotor Implant, rank 3      | 6,000  | 6 points, Dex/Int    | 3\nCerebromotor Implant, rank 4      | 10,000 | 8 points, Dex/Int    | 4\nCerebromotor Implant, rank 5      | 20,000 | 10 points, Dex/Int   | 5\nNeuroregenerative Implant, rank 1 | 1,000  | 2 points, Con/Wis    | 1\nNeuroregenerative Implant, rank 2 | 3,000  | 4 points, Con/Wis    | 2\nNeuroregenerative Implant, rank 3 | 6,000  | 6 points, Con/Wis    | 3\nNeuroregenerative Implant, rank 4 | 10,000 | 8 points, Con/Wis    | 4\nNeuroregenerative Implant, rank 5 | 20,000 | 10 points, Con/Wis   | 5\n\n\n# Psychometabolic Implants\n\nBrainstorm:\n- Iron Fist\n\n## Iron Fist (Psychometabolic, 1 slot, 1,000 CR)\n\n- Unarmed strike inflict heavy kinetic damage\n- Bonus action: add a kinetic charge to next unarmed strike that adds push 5. If subject strikes a wall they take medium kinetic damage from the impact.\n\n## Retractable Blade (Psychometabolic, 1 slot, 1,000 CR)\n\n- Can produce or retract a blade from within your body as a move or bonus action\n- Can be either two medium damage weapons or one heavy damage weapon\n\n## Social Preprocessor (Psychometabolic, 1 slot, 1,000 CR)\n\nHave you ever said \"you too\" after a server told you to enjoy your lunch? Ever mumbled incoherently when asked about your day? Made a fool of yourself trying to ask someone out?\n\nNever again! With the Social Preprocessor, sit back and relax (mentally speaking) while your brain goes on autopilot. Thanks to an AI trained on millions of hours of audio and video of human interactions, the preprocessor knows exactly what to say in any situation. Breeze through hours of small talk at social functions! Ace every interview! Sweep the man/woman/blorgon/etc of your dreams off their feet! And all without feeling anxious and drained after 45 minutes of social exposure.\n\nAlso grants advantage to Charisma checks used for social behavior.\n\n\n## Pheromone Glands (Psychometabolic, 2 slots, 2,000 CR)\n\nThanks to the Ykarrz species, famously able to seduce just about any humanoid in the known universe, Axiom can now synthesize a pheromone that affects humans and a wide variety of humanoids. Depending on intent, the pheromones can produce a powerful sense of community, making the target believe they are part of your \"in\" group, and therefore trust you implicitly; they can also induce other powerful emotions and bodily responses as well.\n\n- Encounter, std, 1 square range; subject humanoid is charmed (Wis neg), incapacitated by bodily infirmity (Con neg), or compelled to satisfy a powerful natural urge (Wis neg).\n\n\n## Command Subroutine Transmitter (Psychometabolic, 3 slots, 5,000 CR)\n\nCommanding minions in battle is taxing, especially when trying to survive enemy fire and make yourself useful at the same time. Why not leave all that to a dedicated computer?\n\nThe CST lets you offload the challenging task of directing the actions of those under your command, transmitting orders to a digital device or another implant, so you don't even need to be in earshot.\n\n- For those who can control minions through summoning/etc, this processor allows you to control 100% more minions than normal.\n\n\n\n# Neuroregenerative Implants\n\n\n## Som-null (Neuroregenerative, 1 slot, 1,000 CR)\n\nWho has time for sleep? Certainly not busy Axiom employees!\n\nThe Som-null implant (credit to Jerry in Accounting for winning the name contest) attaches subprocessors to the limbic system, continually processing long-term memory instead of waiting for a delta wave state. In addition to the benefits of the basal implant, this seems to obviate the need for sleep, relegating it to the dustbin of history!\n\nNote: there have been reports of hallucination, intrusive thoughts, and dimensional displacement for individuals who have gone more than a few days with no sleep. User discretion advised.\n\n\n## Neural Filters (Neuroregerative, 2 slots, 2,000 CR)\n\nThis set of preprocessors analyzes incoming sensory input before allowing it to proceed to the brain. Useful data? Go right on in! Distracting pain? Discomfort? Psychic intrusion? Nah, you'll have to wait outside.\n\n- Nullifies pain-based effects\n- Advantage to save against charm, confusion, any form of sensory or emotional intrusion\n  - On failure, effects still do not take place, but you are unable to act while they would otherwise be in effect\n- Does not block the telepathic reading of thoughts, as this does not use the sensory input system\n\n\n## Healing Factor (Neuroregenerative, 2 slots, 2,000 CR)\n\n- Allows you to take a short rest as a bonus action once per encounter\n\n\n\n## Intradermal Nano-Armor (Neuroregenerative, variable slots)\n\nBuilt-in armor!\n\nSlots | CR     | Armor  | Other\n------|--------|--------|------\n1     | 1,000  | +4     | \n2     | 3,000  | +8     | Resist (critical/sneak attack damage)\n3     | 6,000  | +12    | Resist (all nonmagical weapons)\n\n\n\n\n\n# Cybertech\n\n\n# TITAN Armor System\n\nNobody wants to lose a limb just to get a cool gun attachment or something. (I mean chainsaw, yeah, of course, but gun? Meh.)\n\nThat's why Axiom has perfected the Adjunct-Attached Extra Corpus Augmentation System! By means of extradimensional Adjunct-Space, you can store the bulky, unwieldy parts of your cybernetics in a convenient pocket dimension and just wrap the rest around your body for the full cybernetic experience without all the fuss of immunosuppressants and giant bolts through in your bone marrow!\n\nYou might ask, \"isn't this just armor and not cybernetics\"?\n\nShut up. You get to be Iron Man. Don't ruin this with logic.\n\n\n# Base Modules\n\nThe system requires a base unit, usually worn on the torso (for torsoed individuals). The base unit provides power, internal structure, and connection points for modules.\n\nMore advanced base units provide more power and have more module slots.\n\n\nBase Module | ACR | Power | AC^1^  | Module Slots   | Special\n------------|-----|-------|--------|----------------|--------\nMark I      | 50  | 1     | 16+Dex | 2              |\nMark II     | 150 | 3     | 17+Dex | 3              | \nMark III    | 300 | 5     | 18+Dex | 3+1 high power |\nMark IV     | 450 | 7     | 19+Dex | 4+1 high power |\nMark V      | 600 | 9     | 20+Dex | 4+2 high power |\n\n\nNotes:\n- 1: AC listed requires that armor is fully deployed. If you leave out the helmet to look cool on screen (or to not weird people out), you suffer a -2 to AC.\n\n\n# Modules\n\n\n## Flight Module\n- (50 / 1 slot): fly 50 ft, max 5 rds, recharges in 5 minutes.\n- (100 / 2 slots): fly 100 ft (accel 100%/rd), max 5 minutes, recharges in 5 minutes.\n- (200 / 1 high power slot): fly 100 ft unlimited; overland flight at Mach 2.\n\n## Defense Modules\n- (50 / 1 slot): nano-adaptive armor. Adds +2 AC, immune to armor penetration, adds hardness 10.\n- (100 / 1 slot): ablative armor coating. Adds ablate 10%, max 3 times per encounter.\n- (100 / 1 slot): reflective armor. Adds 25% chance to reflect electromagnetic or ionized thermal (i.e. plasma) attacks, even if magical in origin.\n\n- force shield projector\n\n\n## Weapon Modules\n- (50 / 1 slot): Hand Blasters. Because of course you want them. Ranged, at-will, std; medium thermal damage dual wielded, or one target heavy damage..\n- (100 / 1 slot): Missile Launcher. Fires 5 auto-seeking missiles as a bonus action (magic missile).\n\n- freeze ray\n- maser\n- net launcher\n- gravity bomb\n- plasma sword\n- etc\n\n## Utility Modules\n\n- Optical Camouflage\n- Grappling Hook?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Dev Notes\n\nCategories:\n- Vehicles and vehicle mods\n- Phone apps\n- Weapons\n- Armor\n- Biotech\n- Cybertech\n- Alien\n\nAxiom Credit Rating:\n- A number from 0 to 1000 (or more?)\n- Everything from the Axiom Store you \"own\" counts against this limit\n- You can freely upgrade and exchange items\n\nCost guidelines:\n- Spell at will: 100 per level\n  - Recharge 33%: half\n  - Encounter: quarter\n- Magic item:\n  - Uncommon: 100\n  - Rare: 250\n  - Very Rare: 500\n  - Legendary: 750","bodyHtml":"<h1>Phones</h1>\n<p>Issued at level 1.</p>\n<p>Everyone is issued a standard galactic phone.

Once authenticated, allows you to search records from all compliant internet service providers, corporate databases, and of course government records. Can be used to hack any wireless device (or wired device, using the retractable multi-connector, if close enough), but you still need a Hacking skill to do so.</p>\n<p>No relation to the officer designated &quot;Prism&quot;.</p>\n<h2>Amazon Drone Delivery</h2>\n<p>Need a toaster? A complete 7-disc set of Buffy the Vampire Slayer on Blu-Ray? A package of hot dogs? A loaded AR-15<sup>1</sup>? Amazon Drone Delivery will have your package delivered to your current location<sup>2</sup> (or a desired address) within 30 minutes or...well, there's no penalty if they miss the window, but they usually don't. Axiom members get complementary Rush Service, enjoying a 3d6 minute delivery window within major metropolitan areas!</p>\n<p>Footnotes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1: firearms, recreational drugs, and other hazardous items are prohibited by federal law from delivery via drone, except in the state of Nevada.</li>\n<li>2: service is currently only provided on Earth within 15 kilometers of an Amazon drone facility, or on the secret Martian colony that only rich people have access to.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Pandora</h2>\n<p>Siri? Alexa? Cortana? Forget those dinosaurs. Pandora is your state-of-the-art, quantum-computer-based AI assistant. She's smarter than 95% of the humans you've ever met, and knows everything that humanity has ever known. She's ready to assist you at a moment's notice, because she's always listening. And watching. And judging.</p>\n<h2>BABEL</h2>\n<p>The BABEL program represents the latest in neuro-linguistic brainwave interface. Rather than muck about with speech-to-text and natural language processing, BABEL simply scans the brain waves of whoever is talking to immediately translate any alien language, including cultural connotations and other context computers just can't hack. Oh, and you don't even need to know the language--BABEL will figure it out in real time, with only a small amount of hilarious mis-translation in the first few, tense moments of First Contact. 99% quality guaranteed!</p>\n<p>Only intelligent minds produce such brain waves, so don't go trying to talk to your goldfish with this (although dolphins might have a thing or two to say).</p>\n<p>For recorded video and audio, brainwave scans are no good, but BABEL can still fall back on a hyper-core quantum processor to make its best guess using NLP for known languages.</p>\n<h1>Paid Apps</h1>\n<p>Available to requisition using your Axiom Credit Rating!</p>\n<h2>Neuralizer (1,000 CR)</h2>\n<p>Using what appears to be an ordinary flash for photography, your phone emits a series of extremely rapid pulses of complex electromagnetic radiation, which, when transmitted to the human brain through optic nerves, cause disruption to the hippocampus, effectively wiping out the last 20-30 seconds. For a brief period thereafter, subjects are highly suggestible as to what, in fact, they have just experienced (disadvantage to any relevant saves). This can be disorienting, but has been shown to be mostly harmless in various longitudinal tests.</p>\n<p>Note: for longer-term memory modification, a more powerful app is required.</p>\n<h2>Memory Patcher (4,000 CR)</h2>\n<p>Using similar light pulses to the Neuralizer, but lasting much longer (at least 3 rounds, see description), the Memory Patcher induces a much deeper state of suggestibility, allowing you to guide the target through the process of rewriting memories to an arbitrary depth.</p>\n<p>At-will, std, range 1; subject is stunned (Wis negates). If they fail three saves within 1 minute, they become helpless and highly suggestible. You may then reprogram their memories (assuming you have a shared language). Roll Int to reprogram:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Last few hours: DC 10</li>\n<li>A single thread of memory for the last few days (e.g. sighting a specific strange creature): DC 15</li>\n<li>Experiences along a single thread going back into the depths of long-term memory: DC 20</li>\n<li>If multiple threads, you must repeat the process.</li>\n<li>Failing by 1 or more causes mental damage to the target (DM discretion). Failing by 10 or more additionally causes the memory alteration to fail.</li>\n<li>It is possible to learn proficiency in this tool.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Stun Setting (2,000 CR)</h2>\n<p>Using the &quot;flash&quot; of your phone, you can emit a pulse of light that stuns humanoids, beasts, and generally anything with eyes and central nervous system.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Recharge 33%, std, short range; target is stunned (Con ends).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Greater stun setting (costs 10,000 CR):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At-will, std, short range; target is stunned (Con ends).</li>\n<li>Recharge 33%, std, cone 3; targets are stunned (Con ends).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bio-Scanner (1,000 CR)</h2>\n<p>Using the &quot;camera&quot; array, the phone can scan a humanoid, animal, or known extraterrestrial inside and out, delivering a comprehensive medical report in just under 3 seconds.</p>\n<h2>Clone Scanner (2,000 CR)</h2>\n<p>Upgrade to the Bio-Scanner. Once scanned, you can request that Axiom Cloning Labs generate a clone of the creature. While active, the clone costs ACR based on its effectiveness (i.e. CR). It can be programmed to act like the target (using information from the bio-scanner, PRISM, etc; i.e. using Deception), and/or can be modified as you please.</p>\n<p>Clones take 24 hours to grow, but rush orders can be requested for 2 hour delivery with the Director's approval.</p>\n<h2>Thermal Ray (4,000 CR)</h2>\n<p>A small emitter in the &quot;earpiece&quot; end of the phone can emit a phaser-like beam of energy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At-will, std, short range; beam can cut as effectively as a plasma cutter.</li>\n<li>At-will, std, ranged; heavy fire damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Inventory Screen (2,000 CR+)</h2>\n<p>An app that shows you all items you've stored in your Axiom Near-Dimensional Adjunct Space. By default, that space is a 3m x 3m x 3m room (climate controlled, standard earth atmosphere, about the size of a standard storage unit or half a one-car garage), with a max of 20 objects. As a bonus action, you can store one held item or retrieve one item. Items transition in and out of the Adjunct Space in a digitization process.</p>\n<p>Upgrades:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>10x10x5 room, 100 objects, approx 1.5 car garage, transfer up to 3 items at a time: 5,000 CR</li>\n<li>50x50x10 warehouse, 1000 objects, transfer any items within circle 5: 10,000 CR</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Wormhole Beacon (5,000 CR)</h2>\n<p>The ultimate ride-hailing app, this creates a beacon for a Hyperspace Conduit generator and notifies Dispatch of your requirements. Within 2d6 rounds, a wormhole will appear, allowing transit of anything that can fit through its 2m aperture back to the high-security Staging Area in an undisclosed location, whereby, after passing necessary security screening and decontamination, you can be routed back to Axiom HQ. Emergency transport is possible with Director approval.</p>\n<p>Upgrades:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Point-to-point capability: from anywhere to anywhere (that you also have a beacon). 10,000 CR</li>\n<li>5m aperture: Add 5,000 CR</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Phototemporal Displacement Engine (4,000 CR)</h2>\n<p>Using the camera and screen in your phone or AR glasses, this device allows you to &quot;rewind time&quot;, showing you what whatever is in the field of view of your camera (and within 100 meters of its lens) would have looked like within a specified time in the past (any time from Jan 1 1970 CE to the present day).</p>\n<p>Note: this is not guaranteed to be accurate, as it involves highly complex quantum calculations to predict physical phenomena. The further back you go, the more inaccurate it is. Similarly, since it is prediction based, it can also attempt to predict the future. This can be...extremely inaccurate...depending on what you're looking at.</p>\n<h2>Weather Channel (4,000 CR)</h2>\n<p>Provides a wealth of historical data, precise current weather, and extremely accurate predictions going out several years, for any location in the known universe.</p>\n<p>More importantly, it can change the weather. Just click &quot;edit&quot;, select the desired weather from the dropdown, drag the sliders around, and click &quot;commit&quot;. Then wait 1d4 x 10 minutes.</p>\n<h2>Hologram Generator (2,000 CR+)</h2>\n<p>Using the &quot;flash&quot; array, your phone can generate holograms that you can program (or describe to Pandora) to do whatever you want, as long as they fit within a circle 2 and are made entirely of light.</p>\n<p>Yes, this can be configured as a glamer, as long as the hologram is your size or larger.</p>\n<p>Upgrades:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Auditory: +1,000 CR (act now to receive Olfactory at no extra charge!)</li>\n<li>Hard Light: +2,000 CR (holograms can be &quot;felt&quot; kind of like haptic feedback; much more believable when touched, but still not &quot;real&quot;)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Night-Night Ray (2,000 CR)</h2>\n<p>Using flashing light pulses, your phone causes humanoids, animals, and known extreterrestrials (prone to such things) to become very sleepy, and immediately full unconscious. Only works if they are not already in an agitated state (i.e. alerted to danger).</p>\n<p>Recharge 33%, cone 3; subjects fall asleep on a failed Con save. On success, they become sleepy (disadvantage to checks) until they pass another Con save. Alerting subject to danger ends all effects caused by this ray. Otherwise, they will sleep as dictated by their natural rhythyms, at minimum 90 minutes.</p>\n<h1>Vehicles</h1>\n<h1>Ground Vehicle Upgrade</h1>\n<h2>Convenient Optical Pretense (C.O.P) (1,000 CR)</h2>\n<p>Optical camouflage system allows your vehicle to appear to be any other vehicle, including an emergency vehicle with valid markings, sirens, lights, etc.</p>\n<h2>Unopinionated Tires (2,000 CR)</h2>\n<p>Most tires are so opinionated as to which way is &quot;down&quot;. How droll. These tires could care less. Want to drive on walls? Ceilings? Sure! Just twist the knob to let the tires know. Also, to make things simpler, these tires never directly contact any surface, but cling to a point in space a few millimeters over the average surface grade, which always affords optimal traction in all driving conditions (such as driving up a glass skyscraper, in the rain).</p>\n<h2>Grappling Hook (1,000 CR)</h2>\n<p>Pretty much what the name suggests.</p>\n<h2>Bullet-Proof Armor (2,000 CR)</h2>\n<p>Grants the vehicle an Armor rating of 20 and hardness 20. Glass is replaced with transparent alloys.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Mount (weapon cost)</h2>\n<p>Can mount a vehicle-sized weapon such as a 50mm machine gun or rocket launcher, or several personal-sized weapons. Turrets can be AI or manually operated.</p>\n<h1>Weapons and Tools</h1>\n<h1>Tools</h1>\n<h2>Plasma Cutter (500 CR)</h2>\n<p>A knife-sized blade with a plasma edge, capable of cutting through almost anything.</p>\n<p>Weapon stats: one-hand, light, medium thermal, 18/x2.</p>\n<h1>Military Grade Weapons</h1>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Weapon</th>\n<th>CR</th>\n<th>Range</th>\n<th>Damage</th>\n<th>Critical</th>\n<th>Ammo Capacity / Reload</th>\n<th>Special</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Assault Rifle</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>long range</td>\n<td>heavy kinetic</td>\n<td>19/x3</td>\n<td>30, bonus/move</td>\n<td>Full Auto, Burst Fire, Semi Auto</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sniper Rifle</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>extreme</td>\n<td>heavy kinetic</td>\n<td>19/x3</td>\n<td>6, std</td>\n<td>Semi Auto, Sniper</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rocket Launcher</td>\n<td>2,000</td>\n<td>propelled</td>\n<td>heavy explosive burst 3</td>\n<td>20/x2</td>\n<td>1, move</td>\n<td>Guided</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Laser Pistol</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>medium</td>\n<td>medium thermal</td>\n<td>18/x2</td>\n<td>20, move</td>\n<td>Armor Piercing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Laser Rifle</td>\n<td>2,000</td>\n<td>long</td>\n<td>heavy thermal</td>\n<td>18/x2</td>\n<td>30, move</td>\n<td>Armor Piercing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Plasma Sword</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>melee</td>\n<td>heavy thermal</td>\n<td>19/x3</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>Armor Piercing, cuts through anything</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Maser</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>medium</td>\n<td>medium EM (subdual)</td>\n<td>18/x2</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>Stuns bio and robot targets</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Specials:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Semi Auto: no action to reload between shots, even multiple times per round.

Controls reaction speed, reflex, and quickness of wit.</li>\n<li>Neuroregenerative System: the system that allows the CNS to regulate itself, and, in some cases, regeneration.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These basal implants provide a certain baseline benefit, but primarily act as an interface for artificial implants that enhance specific functionality.</p>\n<p>Baseline benefit grants 2 bonus attribute points to be divided as you wish between 2 candidate attributes. For instance, a psychometabolic implant might grant 4 points to Str/Cha, allowing you to select +2 to each, +4 to one and +0 to the other, +3/+1, etc. To adjust this ratio, please see an Axiom Implant Specialist.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Basal Implant</th>\n<th>CR</th>\n<th>Baseline Benefit</th>\n<th>Enhancement Slots</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Psychometabolic Implant, rank 1</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>2 points, Str/Cha</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Psychometabolic Implant, rank 2</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>4 points, Str/Cha</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Psychometabolic Implant, rank 3</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>6 points, Str/Cha</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Psychometabolic Implant, rank 4</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n<td>8 points, Str/Cha</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Psychometabolic Implant, rank 5</td>\n<td>20,000</td>\n<td>10 points, Str/Cha</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cerebromotor Implant, rank 1</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>2 points, Dex/Int</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cerebromotor Implant, rank 2</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>4 points, Dex/Int</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cerebromotor Implant, rank 3</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>6 points, Dex/Int</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cerebromotor Implant, rank 4</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n<td>8 points, Dex/Int</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cerebromotor Implant, rank 5</td>\n<td>20,000</td>\n<td>10 points, Dex/Int</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Neuroregenerative Implant, rank 1</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>2 points, Con/Wis</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Neuroregenerative Implant, rank 2</td>\n<td>3,000</td>\n<td>4 points, Con/Wis</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Neuroregenerative Implant, rank 3</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n<td>6 points, Con/Wis</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Neuroregenerative Implant, rank 4</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n<td>8 points, Con/Wis</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Neuroregenerative Implant, rank 5</td>\n<td>20,000</td>\n<td>10 points, Con/Wis</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1>Psychometabolic Implants</h1>\n<p>Brainstorm:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Iron Fist</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Iron Fist (Psychometabolic, 1 slot, 1,000 CR)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Unarmed strike inflict heavy kinetic damage</li>\n<li>Bonus action: add a kinetic charge to next unarmed strike that adds push 5.
