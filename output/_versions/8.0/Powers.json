[{"name":"Invocation","contents":"# Invoker\n\nCommonly--and quite inaccurately--named \"warlocks\", Invokers are magical practitioners who specialize in invoking the powers of Outer Planes, and of the denizens therein.\n\nA common misconception is that Invokers have a solitary, unbreakable bond with a single planar overlord. While this arrangement is not unheard of, it rarely results in a long and lucrative career for the Invoker. Anybody can sell their soul--that doesn't make them a Invoker. Instead, the wise Invoker follows the Principle of Equal Exchange, the fundamental law of the Pact. In essence, all Outsiders, regardless of outward appearance or presumed morality, are supernaturally bound to honor contracts and deals, and when a debt is repaid, it is repaid. The devil is, of course, in the details, and thus the true measure of a successful Invoker is whether they can harness the power of Outsiders without becoming hopelessly entrapped by them.\n\nOf course, it is hardly uncommon for a Invoker not to have some sort of debt or kinship he can't easily rid himself of, and this is handled separately. As a rule, Invoker spells and rituals are self-balancing and do not imply permanent debt, while [[#Corruption]] results when a Invoker, wittingly or otherwise, permanently exchanges some sort of debt or bondage in exchange for power.\n\n\n# Basic Abilities\n\n<!--\nAttribute     | Value\n---------     | -----\nHit Die       | d8\nHP/level      | 5\nWeapon Prof.  | None\nArmor Prof.   | None\nSaving Throws | Int, Cha\n-->\n\nBrief version:\n- Your primary limiting factor is Corruption, an attribute describing how much your planar powers have corrupted your soul. You gain it by using expensive powers, and reduce it by either purifying yourself or coercing others into accepting some of it. You can gain a lot of power by accepting permanent Corruption.\n- Summons: corruption-free, loyal extraplanar minions that you can improve with feats.\n- Bindings: permanent or at-will magical abilities that generally don't cause corruption to use, because you already accepted permanent corruption to gain them.\n- Invocations: spell-like abilities which generally cause corruption, but are quite powerful.\n\n\n# Core skills\n- Spellcraft (Int): used to conduct invocation rituals, such as summoning, banishing, or commanding extraplanar creatures.\n- Concentration (Wis): used to resist Corruption.\n- Willpower (Cha): your ability to command loyalty or otherwise impose your will upon extraplanar creatures.\n\nUses:\n- Spellcraft\n  - Detect planar alignment: detects extraplanar creatures, portals, extraplanar magical effects. Determine planar origin of same.\n  - Magic circle: creates a magical barrier for containing extraplanar creatures, or protecting yourself from same.\n  - Summon outsider: summons an extraplanar creature.\n  - Command outsider: subjects an extraplanar creature to your will.\n  - Banish outsider: sends an extraplanar creature back to its home plane.\n- Concentration\n  - Resist Corruption\n- Willpower\n  - Used during Summon, Command, and Banish\n  - Determines most abilities of bound minions\n  - \n\n\n# Corruption\n- Minimum: 0\n- Threshold: 1/2 level + Wis\n\nBelow the threshold, Corruption has no in-game effect (but may have several minor cosmetic effects). When at or above the threshold, you must pass Concentration checks each time you gain Corruption, and at certain other times determined by the DM.\n\nA Concentration check's DC is equal to 10 + your Corruption.\n- Complete success: no effect.\n- Mixed success: you are Tempted, a state the DM can take advantage of at a later time.\n- Failure: you are Tainted. At any time, the DM can attempt to compel you into an action you might not have otherwise willed.\n\nWhen \"Tempted\", the DM can, at an opportune time, offer you a deal on behalf of the planar forces from which you gain power. This must be at a time when your character would be reasonably willing to borrow power for some worthwhile gain. The deal is generally the same as any other action you might have taken: for a given Corruption cost, you gain a certain effect. However, the power can be something you couldn't normally access, or have a powerful enhancement such as using it while you are incapacitated, or as an immediate action, or having empowered effect. In any case, you must pass a Concentration check to resist (you can voluntarily fail if you choose). If you fail the check, you gain 1 (or more, if specified) Corruption, along with the designated benefit. The \"Tempted\" state disappears, but naturally, you must now roll a fresh Concentration check since you just gained Corruption.\n\nWhen you are \"Tainted\", the DM can, at any time, attempt to force you to take actions. These actions can be anything, although they will generally serve the purposes of whatever planar source powers you--as opposed to being simply inconvenient or downright hostile to you and your allies. To resist, you must pass a Concentration check.\n- Complete success: you don't take the action, and instead act however you wish.\n- Mixed success: you don't take the action, but you lose your turn, or instead gain 1 Corruption.\n- Failure: you take the action.\n- In any case, after the roll and the subsequent action, your Corruption decreases by 1. If it falls below the threshold, you are no longer Tainted.\n\n\n# Relieving/Mitigating Corruption\n\nReduce Corruption you have gained is possible, but it takes time. Some of the most reliable ways are to purify yourself with an opposing energy (e.g. prayer or service to a good deity can remove the taint of Infernal power), or to coerce other mortals into service to your planar faction (e.g. tempting mortals to sin please the Infernal plane, rewarding you with reduced Corruption and therfore more agency to continue your great work).\n\nIn game terms, the above is a \"down time\" action that generally takes longer than a long rest and only fits into the time between episodes. Many adventurers need a quicker fix than that. There are a few other ways to rid yourself of Corruption, or indeed prevent it before it occurs:\n\n- Soul Shards: shards of mortal souls are the most valuable commodity in every non-prime plane, worth far more than gold or diamonds. Invokers can capture shards of mortal souls--or even souls entire--and place them into tradeable form. Although one cannot promise anything on behalf of another mortal, it is much easier for an outsider to parley with a mortal on their own terms, deep within their plane, then it is on the Prime Material. Thus, soul shards can pay off Corruption, or otherwise purchase Corruption-free power. This is generally not a morally justifiable decision, if you're concerned about that sort of thing.\n- Contract: by communing with representatives of your planar source, you can enter a contract where you perform some service, in exchange for relief of a given amount of Corruption.\n- Transfer: Corruption is a commodity. You accept it into your soul when you willingly choose to. Others can accept it from you, just as they could have accepted it from your planar source. Thus, you can arrange a transfer with any other Invoker, extraplanar creature, deity, or other suitably magical being with its own will, if you can otherwise get them to agree to it.\n\n\n\n# Bindings\n\nBindings do not cost feats or powers. When you accept a binding, you permanently gain its effect, and increase your minimum Corruption by the amount listed.\n\n**You can spend a feat to reduce Corruption cost of a given binding by 1.**\n\nName         | Corruption | Effect\n-------------|------------|-------\nArmor        | 1          | Gain a bonus to Armor equal to Cha + 1/2 level.

Anything crossing it suffers medium necrotic damage.\n- [Shadow Double](): At-will, swift, ranged, concentration; you create a shadowy double of yourself or a chosen subject. The double is under your control, and has the same physical abilities as the subject.

Subject suffers 1 level of enervation (-1 to all checks, disabled if enervation levels > hit dice). Choose one of the following:\n  - Fetish: you drain one of the subject's ability scores. They suffer a -4 penalty to that score while the soul shard exists, and you gain +4 to the same score. Lasts up to 24 hours.\n  - Phylactery: you use the soul fragment as the component for a phylactery (see [Create Phylactery]()).\n  - Steal Ability: you gain access to a single chosen power, maneuver, or skill that the subject possesses, while you retain the shard. Lasts up to 24 hours.\n\n\n# Void\n- [Star of the Void](): At-will, std, ranged; you summon a mote of pure void that annihilates anything it touches. Each round that you spend an action to control it, it moves as you desire, flying up to 10 squares and attacking one target (optionally). Target suffers heavy disintegration damage on contact (Reflex half). If you do not spend an action to control it, it acts however it wants (use the *Confusion* rules). To end the spell, you must spend an action to send it away. Anyone else with knowledge of this spell can contest your will for control of the Star.\n- [Disintegrate](): At-will, std, ranged; heavy disintegration damage (Fort half).\n- [Void Shield](): At-will, swift, concentration; you \"wield\" a disc of absolute blackness. As a reaction, you can absorb any incoming targeted effect. Spells and projectiles are annihilated on contact. Melee attackers can roll Reflex to pull back their attack; if they fail to do so, their weapon is annihilated. Unarmed attackers get a similar save to avoid heavy disintegration damage. Magic items get a Willpower save to avoid destruction. This spell is probably OP.\n- [Hungering Void](): At-will, std, ranged, 1 square; you tear open a hole in reality, sucking everything toward it, and ejecting whatever falls into it into deepest night. This spell is super OP and I have to figure out how to balance it.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Feats\nEach time you select one of the below feats, you also gain:\n- +1 HP/level\n- +1 Spellcraft, Concentration, Willpower\n- +0.5 Fortitude, Reflex\n\n\n\n\n# Spell Enhancements\n- Mirror Image: modifies *Veil*.\n- Rainbow Beam: modifies *Color Spray*. Area changes to line 20x1 or 10x2. Each target is hit with a chosen color (can be different for each target).\n- Greater Sprites: modifies *Summon Sprite*. Existing sprites are enhanced, and new options added:\n  - Fire sprite: light fire damage plus half ongoing 3 rds.\n  - Frost sprite: light frost damage plus chilled (Fort ends).\n  - Wind sprite: light lightning damage plus same if subject leaves their square in the next 1 rd.\n  - Brain sprite: light psychic damage plus confusion (Will ends).\n  - Arcane sprite: light arcane damage, or a dispel attempt. On sacrifice, dispel all instances of a spell in a burst 2.\n  - Death sprite: light necrotic damage plus Resist 50% (healing) for 3 rds.\n\n\n# Bladebound\n- Bound Arms: at-will, swift; you \"summon\" one of your minions, but rather than giving them an independent form, you bind them into the shape of a weapon, or into the form of an existing weapon. In the former case, the weapon's stats are equal to a normal martial weapon you are proficient with.\n  - Imp: adds medium fire damage, plus light fire ongoing for 3 rds.\n  - Pixie: can put enemies to sleep, or adds +10 critical threat range.\n  - Succubus: adds medium necrotic damage, can entangle and wrack.\n- Fusion: at-will, swift; you \"summon\" one of your minions, but rather than giving them an independent form, you bind them into the shape of armor, or into the form of your existing armor. In the former case, the armor's stats are equal to a normal armor type you are proficient with. Examples:\n  - Voidwalker: Absorb 50% (any), limit medium damage each round. Resist shadow/necrotic.\n  - etc\n- Armiger: summon a bunch of weapons at once, costs Corruption, etc.\n\n\n# Summoner\n- Rapid Summons: your minion-summoning spells with a standard action are now swift actions; those that were already swift are free (once/rd).\n- Soul Link: when a minion is within range, half the damage you suffer is transferred to them. Any death or loss-of-control effect you suffer has a 50% chance of transferring to the minion.\n- Sacrifice: at-will, reaction; you sacrifice an active minion, expending them as if they reached 0 HP, but producing a powerful effect:\n  - Imp: close burst 5, heavy fire damage plus half ongoing for 3 rds.\n  - Succubus: TBD\n  - Pixie: close burst 5, allies can choose to teleport anywhere in range that they can see, and they become invisible until they attack or take damage (or until 1 hour passes).\n  - Felhunter: close burst 5, dispel attempt against a chosen effect on each target, or dispel attempt against each effect on one target. Allies gain Resist 50% (magic) for 2 rounds.\n  - Voidwalker: close burst 5, allies gain Absorb 100% (all, limit Voidwalker's max HP).\n  - Sprite: close burst 2, same effect as a normal attack, but double damagee.\n- Evolution: advances your minion to a more powerful form. Examples:\n  - Void Knight: has Pound, Gravity, Shadowy Shield.\n  - Ethereal: more powerful shade that has enhanced abilities while ethereal.\n  - Sylph: pixie that can heal you, put enemies to sleep, aura grants allies bonus movement.\n  - Dread Stalker: more deadly felhunter. Has cool dredlocks. Has Phase Shift, Shadow Tunnel, grants allies magic detection.\n- Minion Resilience: your Minions gain 2 HP/level.\n- Share Senses: you gain your minions' extra senses.\n\n\n\n# Minions\n\nPowers such as [Summon Pixie]() grants you the listed minion as a permanent ally.\n\nAlthough each minion has a \"canonical\" flavor (e.g. Pixie is Fey, Imp is Infernal), all Invokers can select any minions they choose, and re-flavor as desired. A fey invoker might summon a \"redcap\" with Imp stats, or a Shadow invoker could summon a \"shadow stalker\" with Felhunter stats, for example.\n\nNotes on summoning:\n- You can only control one summoned minion at a time (summoned via an Invoker spell with \"summon\" in the title). The exception is Summon Sprites, which does not apply to the limit, nor do other summons apply to that spell's limit.\n- Invokers who use Willpower can attempt to control multiple minions at a time. Whenever the number of minions changes, and that number is higher than 1, roll Willpower opposed to Cha save for each minion; on success, they are controlled, and on failure, they run wild.\n- Minions have their own HP and Mana pools. When they reach 0 HP, they are immediately unsummoned, and cannot be summoned again for 24 hours, after which they are restored to 100% HP and Mana.\n- Minions can take a long rest, either in the prime material plane or when away from you.\n\n\n\n# Pixie\n- Ability scores: her Dex and Cha = your Int/Wis/Cha (whichever is highest), others are 0\n- Saves: Dex, Cha\n- Size: tiny\n- Movement: fly 6\n- AC: 10 + Dex\n- HP: 1 per level\n- Mana: 1 per level\n- Attacks:\n  - Needle: std, melee, Dex vs AC; light arcane damage.\n- Special:\n  - Sneak Attack: against unaware targets, inflict critical damage.\n  - Invisibility: swift, recharge 33%; pixie becomes invisible until she attacks or takes damage.\n  - Legerdemain: she is proficient in Acrobatics, Stealth, and Sleight of Hand\n  - Sleep: can put a single target to sleep on successful sneak attack if they are unaware.\n  - Pixie Dust: can cause a single target to laugh or sneeze uncontrollably (Con ends), or similar usage of dust (e.g. drug trips).\n\n## Evolution: Sylph\n- +2 HP/level\n- Healing Dust: recharge 33%, swift, touch; heals subject for medium damage.\n- Think Happy Thoughts: emanation 10; allies gain a fly speed equal to walking speed.\n- Arcane Arrow: at-will, std; medium arcane damage, 20/x3.\n- Improved Invisibility: Invisibility becomes at-will.\n\n\n# Felhunter\n- Ability scores: Str and Con = your Int/Wis/Cha (whichever is highest), Dex and Wis are half that, Int and Cha 0\n- Saves: Str, Con\n- Size: medium\n- Movement: walk 6\n- AC: 10 + Dex + proficiency bonus\n- HP: 2 per level\n- Attacks:\n  - Bite: std, melee, Str vs AC; light piercing damage, plus one special:\n    - Spell Lock: next spell subject casts, they must pass a Concentration check against the damage of the bite in order not to lose the spell.

One humanoid that the shade can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the shade; the shade then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The shade now controls the body but doesn’t deprive the target of awareness. The shade can’t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target’s statistics, but doesn’t gain access to the target’s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the shade ends it as a bonus action, or the shade is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the shade reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this shade’s Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.\n- Special:\n  - Ethereal Sight. The Shade can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.\n  - Scan: ranged, swift; determines the physical and metaphysical makeup of the target (level of intelligence, spellcasting, etc).\n\n## Variant: Spirit of Intellect\n- Replace Chill Touch with Steal Knowledge\n\n\n\n\n# Nightmare\n- http://5e.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/nightmare.htm\n\n\n## Astral Steed (variant)\n- Str +4 Dex +2 Con +3 Int +0 Wis +1 Cha +5\n- Walk 60-ft, Fly 90-ft\n- HP 2 per level\n- Defenses:\n  - Immune to color-based magic\n  - Resist (arcane)\n- Attacks:\n  - Hoof: std melee; (str+prof) vs AC, medium bludgeoning damage plus one Color Spray effect\n\n### Evolution\n- Astral Jaunt","bodyHtml":"<h1>Invoker</h1>\n<p>Commonly--and quite inaccurately--named &quot;warlocks&quot;, Invokers are magical practitioners who specialize in invoking the powers of Outer Planes, and of the denizens therein.</p>\n<p>A common misconception is that Invokers have a solitary, unbreakable bond with a single planar overlord. While this arrangement is not unheard of, it rarely results in a long and lucrative career for the Invoker. Anybody can sell their soul--that doesn't make them a Invoker. Instead, the wise Invoker follows the Principle of Equal Exchange, the fundamental law of the Pact. In essence, all Outsiders, regardless of outward appearance or presumed morality, are supernaturally bound to honor contracts and deals, and when a debt is repaid, it is repaid. The devil is, of course, in the details, and thus the true measure of a successful Invoker is whether they can harness the power of Outsiders without becoming hopelessly entrapped by them.</p>\n<p>Of course, it is hardly uncommon for a Invoker not to have some sort of debt or kinship he can't easily rid himself of, and this is handled separately. As a rule, Invoker spells and rituals are self-balancing and do not imply permanent debt, while [[#Corruption]] results when a Invoker, wittingly or otherwise, permanently exchanges some sort of debt or bondage in exchange for power.</p>\n<h1>Basic Abilities</h1>\n<!--\nAttribute     | Value\n---------     | -----\nHit Die       | d8\nHP/level      | 5\nWeapon Prof.  | None\nArmor Prof.   | None\nSaving Throws | Int, Cha\n-->\n<p>Brief version:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your primary limiting factor is Corruption, an attribute describing how much your planar powers have corrupted your soul. You gain it by using expensive powers, and reduce it by either purifying yourself or coercing others into accepting some of it. You can gain a lot of power by accepting permanent Corruption.</li>\n<li>Summons: corruption-free, loyal extraplanar minions that you can improve with feats.</li>\n<li>Bindings: permanent or at-will magical abilities that generally don't cause corruption to use, because you already accepted permanent corruption to gain them.</li>\n<li>Invocations: spell-like abilities which generally cause corruption, but are quite powerful.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Core skills</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Spellcraft (Int): used to conduct invocation rituals, such as summoning, banishing, or commanding extraplanar creatures.</li>\n<li>Concentration (Wis): used to resist Corruption.</li>\n<li>Willpower (Cha): your ability to command loyalty or otherwise impose your will upon extraplanar creatures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Uses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spellcraft\n<ul>\n<li>Detect planar alignment: detects extraplanar creatures, portals, extraplanar magical effects. Determine planar origin of same.</li>\n<li>Magic circle: creates a magical barrier for containing extraplanar creatures, or protecting yourself from same.</li>\n<li>Summon outsider: summons an extraplanar creature.</li>\n<li>Command outsider: subjects an extraplanar creature to your will.</li>\n<li>Banish outsider: sends an extraplanar creature back to its home plane.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Concentration\n<ul>\n<li>Resist Corruption</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Willpower\n<ul>\n<li>Used during Summon, Command, and Banish</li>\n<li>Determines most abilities of bound minions</li>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Corruption</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Minimum: 0</li>\n<li>Threshold: 1/2 level + Wis</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below the threshold, Corruption has no in-game effect (but may have several minor cosmetic effects). When at or above the threshold, you must pass Concentration checks each time you gain Corruption, and at certain other times determined by the DM.</p>\n<p>A Concentration check's DC is equal to 10 + your Corruption.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete success: no effect.</li>\n<li>Mixed success: you are Tempted, a state the DM can take advantage of at a later time.</li>\n<li>Failure: you are Tainted. At any time, the DM can attempt to compel you into an action you might not have otherwise willed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When &quot;Tempted&quot;, the DM can, at an opportune time, offer you a deal on behalf of the planar forces from which you gain power. This must be at a time when your character would be reasonably willing to borrow power for some worthwhile gain. The deal is generally the same as any other action you might have taken: for a given Corruption cost, you gain a certain effect. However, the power can be something you couldn't normally access, or have a powerful enhancement such as using it while you are incapacitated, or as an immediate action, or having empowered effect. In any case, you must pass a Concentration check to resist (you can voluntarily fail if you choose). If you fail the check, you gain 1 (or more, if specified) Corruption, along with the designated benefit. The &quot;Tempted&quot; state disappears, but naturally, you must now roll a fresh Concentration check since you just gained Corruption.</p>\n<p>When you are &quot;Tainted&quot;, the DM can, at any time, attempt to force you to take actions. These actions can be anything, although they will generally serve the purposes of whatever planar source powers you--as opposed to being simply inconvenient or downright hostile to you and your allies. To resist, you must pass a Concentration check.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete success: you don't take the action, and instead act however you wish.</li>\n<li>Mixed success: you don't take the action, but you lose your turn, or instead gain 1 Corruption.</li>\n<li>Failure: you take the action.</li>\n<li>In any case, after the roll and the subsequent action, your Corruption decreases by 1. If it falls below the threshold, you are no longer Tainted.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Relieving/Mitigating Corruption</h1>\n<p>Reduce Corruption you have gained is possible, but it takes time. Some of the most reliable ways are to purify yourself with an opposing energy (e.g. prayer or service to a good deity can remove the taint of Infernal power), or to coerce other mortals into service to your planar faction (e.g. tempting mortals to sin please the Infernal plane, rewarding you with reduced Corruption and therfore more agency to continue your great work).</p>\n<p>In game terms, the above is a &quot;down time&quot; action that generally takes longer than a long rest and only fits into the time between episodes. Many adventurers need a quicker fix than that. There are a few other ways to rid yourself of Corruption, or indeed prevent it before it occurs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Soul Shards: shards of mortal souls are the most valuable commodity in every non-prime plane, worth far more than gold or diamonds. Invokers can capture shards of mortal souls--or even souls entire--and place them into tradeable form. Although one cannot promise anything on behalf of another mortal, it is much easier for an outsider to parley with a mortal on their own terms, deep within their plane, then it is on the Prime Material. Thus, soul shards can pay off Corruption, or otherwise purchase Corruption-free power. This is generally not a morally justifiable decision, if you're concerned about that sort of thing.</li>\n<li>Contract: by communing with representatives of your planar source, you can enter a contract where you perform some service, in exchange for relief of a given amount of Corruption.</li>\n<li>Transfer: Corruption is a commodity. You accept it into your soul when you willingly choose to. Others can accept it from you, just as they could have accepted it from your planar source. Thus, you can arrange a transfer with any other Invoker, extraplanar creature, deity, or other suitably magical being with its own will, if you can otherwise get them to agree to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Bindings</h1>\n<p>Bindings do not cost feats or powers. When you accept a binding, you permanently gain its effect, and increase your minimum Corruption by the amount listed.</p>\n<p><strong>You can spend a feat to reduce Corruption cost of a given binding by 1.</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Corruption</th>\n<th>Effect</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Armor</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Gain a bonus to Armor equal to Cha + 1/2 level.

Whenever the number of minions changes, and that number is higher than 1, roll Willpower opposed to Cha save for each minion; on success, they are controlled, and on failure, they run wild.</li>\n<li>Minions have their own HP and Mana pools. When they reach 0 HP, they are immediately unsummoned, and cannot be summoned again for 24 hours, after which they are restored to 100% HP and Mana.</li>\n<li>Minions can take a long rest, either in the prime material plane or when away from you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Pixie</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability scores: her Dex and Cha = your Int/Wis/Cha (whichever is highest), others are 0</li>\n<li>Saves: Dex, Cha</li>\n<li>Size: tiny</li>\n<li>Movement: fly 6</li>\n<li>AC: 10 + Dex</li>\n<li>HP: 1 per level</li>\n<li>Mana: 1 per level</li>\n<li>Attacks:\n<ul>\n<li>Needle: std, melee, Dex vs AC; light arcane damage.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Special:\n<ul>\n<li>Sneak Attack: against unaware targets, inflict critical damage.</li>\n<li>Invisibility: swift, recharge 33%; pixie becomes invisible until she attacks or takes damage.</li>\n<li>Legerdemain: she is proficient in Acrobatics, Stealth, and Sleight of Hand</li>\n<li>Sleep: can put a single target to sleep on successful sneak attack if they are unaware.</li>\n<li>Pixie Dust: can cause a single target to laugh or sneeze uncontrollably (Con ends), or similar usage of dust (e.g. drug trips).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Evolution: Sylph</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>+2 HP/level</li>\n<li>Healing Dust: recharge 33%, swift, touch; heals subject for medium damage.</li>\n<li>Think Happy Thoughts: emanation 10; allies gain a fly speed equal to walking speed.</li>\n<li>Arcane Arrow: at-will, std; medium arcane damage, 20/x3.</li>\n<li>Improved Invisibility: Invisibility becomes at-will.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Felhunter</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability scores: Str and Con = your Int/Wis/Cha (whichever is highest), Dex and Wis are half that, Int and Cha 0</li>\n<li>Saves: Str, Con</li>\n<li>Size: medium</li>\n<li>Movement: walk 6</li>\n<li>AC: 10 + Dex + proficiency bonus</li>\n<li>HP: 2 per level</li>\n<li>Attacks:\n<ul>\n<li>Bite: std, melee, Str vs AC; light piercing damage, plus one special:\n<ul>\n<li>Spell Lock: next spell subject casts, they must pass a Concentration check against the damage of the bite in order not to lose the spell.

A female spellcaster? \n\nAbsolutely not.\n\nThaumaturgy is one of the fundamental arts of spellcasting. It is the study and practice of the Law of Sympathy: as above, so below, as without, so within, etc. Parts of a whole have what is called a \"sympathetic link\" to the whole. This enables such magic as a phylactery: a totem created with a small sample of a creature which can be used to locate them or bind magic to them. All spellcasters use thaumaturgy to some degree.\n\nWitchcraft is the deep study and mastery of both thaumaturgy, and of the fundamental revelation that All is Connected: sympathetic bonds tie together all of the cosmos. No action or individual exists in isolation, and therefore no working of magic goes without consequence. Witches understand their place within the grand cosmic working of magic--a profound and awesome experience, but a humbling one as well. They realize that every spell they casts has an equivalent reaction--it may not immediately rebound upon them, but it will, in its course, take its toll. And thus, they understand that all harmful magic--all of it, always--returns the ill will of the caster back onto herself, in some way, at some point.\n\nThis, understandably, has a dramatic impact on the way witches work magic, as compared to others who do not or cannot see this connection.\n\nThe study of a magical working's \"intent\"--i.e. for good, ill, or neutral--is called its Chroma. Likened to a spectrum of colors, Chroma reflects the nuance of nature--it is hardly black and white, so labels such as \"black magic\" and \"white magic\" are laughable to true students of witchcraft. A thorough understanding of Chroma allows witches to work magic to their advantage without accumulating too many negative consequences.\n\n\n# Basic Abilities\n\nBrief version:\n- Your primary limiting factor is Vitae, which is simply a quantification of life energy. You have some within you, as do all living creatures. Your own is handy for use, but obviously quite precious and shouldn't be expended too much. You can use the Vitae of others, or existing within the natural world--it works just as well to empower your spells.\n- Your secondary limiting factor is Chroma, a measure of the moral intent of spellcasting. Harmful magic tends to rebound upon you in time, while helpful magic reduces that effect.\n- Things you can learn with talents:\n  - Spells: pretty obvious what these are.\n  - Bindings: permanent or at-will magical abilities that generally don't cost Vitae to use, but rather reduce the Vitae you have available to power other spells.\n  - Felicity: reflections of the harmony you share with the essence of magic.\n  - Name TBD: invocations of Chroma itself.\n\n\n# Core skills\n\n# Old section, plz ignore\n- You use Spellcraft (Int) to cast spells.\n- You use Concentration (Wis) to sustain your spells and Perception (Wis) to perceive and understand the workings of Chroma.\n- You use Willpower (Cha) to try to work Chroma to your will. Your Charisma also factors into your Felicity powers.\n\n# Thaumaturgy\n\n## Clarity\n\nYou perceive the flow of magic.\n- Rank 1: detect magical auras on sight, spend a swift action to analyze one (Spellcraft check) to learn its power level, school, and approximate purpose.\n- Rank 2: detect magical auras regardless of concealment, instantly detect level, school, and sphere. etc\n\n\n## Ritual Spells\n\n### Rank 1\n- Command Undead: At-will, swift, short range; you dominate targeted undead creature (Will ends, 3 strike rule, 10% penalty per failure). May slot reserve to bind until sunrise.\n  - Reversed: At-will, swift, short range; you release targeted undead creature from the domination of another. Subject is allowed 3 Will saves to end domination, only 1 success if needed. If all 3 fail, subject cannot be freed by this ritual until after sunrise.\n- Death Sight: At-will, concentration; you see through the eyes of an undead minion under your control, and establish a telepathic link through which you may command it; max range 1 mile/level.\n  - Reversed: Recharge 33%, swift, medium range; subject undead is blinded (Fort ends).\n- Evoke Flame: Free, medium range; targeted blood, freshly spilled within last 3 rounds, burst into flames, providing heat and light and igniting flammable objects as normal. Blood burns as long as you remain in long range, or until the sun rises.\n  - Reversed: Free; you suffer medium physical damage, letting your blood flow, which you then cast in a short cone. Any fires in the area, natural or otherwise, are immediately quenched.\n- Create Phylactery: 10 minutes, reagent cost (1 sp plus a sympathetic component); you create a - phylactery: being an object that uses sympathetic magic to create a thaumaturgical connection to another creature. The key ingredient is a sympathetic component, such as blood, hair, or even a prized possession. The object's composition does not matter much; usually, it is a simple doll. The phylactery allows the following uses:\n  - Locate Creature: at-will; as you concentrate, you sense the direction of the creature, and the rough distance (1 yard, 10 yards, 100 yards, 1 mile, 10 miles, 100 miles, etc).\n  - Spirit Link: at-will; you create a mental link to the creature. You may speak to the subject through that creature. You perceive the subject and its most immediate surroundings (a few feet). Lasts as long as you concentrate.\n  - Transmit Weal or Woe: at-will; you may cast a spell or use a physical attack against the doll. This transmits the effect of the spell or attack to the subject, over any distance, bypassing all wards. Each such attack has a 25% chance of destroying the doll permanently.\n  - Recall Spirit: 1 minute cast, concentration, subject must be dead; you conjure the creature's spirit, allowing communication. If unwilling to cooperate, you may force the subject spirit to answer questions (Will ends effect, one save per question). Destroys phylactery.\n  - Steal Visage: 1 minute cast, reserve; you take the form of subject, down to the most minute detail. You know important knowledge the subject would know, such as the names and faces of his close companions. To recall an important detail, such as a secret only he would know, when prompted for it, you may force it from the phylactery (Will ends; a passed save means you can conjure no more secrets this casting). Destroys phylactery.\n\n### Rank 2\n- Death and Rebirth: 10 minutes, reagent (1 living creature of the same type as the subject, e.g. \"natural humanoid\"); you sacrifice a living creature, and use its passing to resurrect a subject who has been dead for up to 1 day/level.\nReversed: Dead subject quickly decays into dust; in a radius around the subject, verdant life springs forth from the ground, in full bloom. Radius is based on the level of subject (10 yards for minor creatures, otherwise 100 yards per level). Optionally, subject's bones remain.\n\n### Rank 3\n- Create Hearthstone: 10 minutes, reagent (a stone from the destination hearth, plus 10 gp); you create a stone which allows you to teleport to the destination hearth. A hearthstone has a 1 hour cooldown.\n  - Reversed: 10 minutes, reagent (one hearthstone); you destroy the hearthstone, and the hearth to which it is meant to teleport its user, negating the function of any other hearthstones connected to it.\n- Create Greater Phylactery: 1 hour, reagent cost (1 gp plus a strong sympathetic component); as Create Phylactery, but requires the strongest of sympathetic components, such as a vial of fresh blood (no more than 5 minutes exposed at start of ritual) or a portion of subject's soul. Allows all uses of a standard phylactery, plus:\n  - Transmit Weal or Woe: same as normal, except phylactery can suffer 5 \"hits\" before being destroyed.\n  - Steal Visage: same as normal, but does not destroy phylactery.\n  - Steal Spell: at-will; you may cast a spell that the subject knows, as if you knew it.\nMagnify Harm: constant; any harm you inflict upon subject directly (not through Transmit Weal or Woe) is increased in effectiveness by 50%.\n  - Domination: at-will, concentration; you may control subject's actions (Contest of Wills).\n\n\n\n# Spells\n\n\n\n# Bindings\n\n\n# Felicity\nThe path of the Witch is challenging. Upon realization of the reality of Chroma, a witch realizes she is more limited than other casters--or rather, she is simply aware of limitations they too possess, but are too naive to notice. This somewhat reduces the outright usefulness of magic, especially to an adventurer, who might, for intance, find frequent need for harmful magic.\n\nThere is an advantage to this inconvenient knowledge. By understanding magic on a more fundamental level, witches find themselves in greater harmony with magic than other practitioners. The Felicity talents express this ability, granting advantages that reflect how magic itself tends to favor you, sometimes more so than its wielder.\n\nSome of these talents reserve Vitae, and some have Chroma requirements. Some have no requirements.\n\n- Absorb Magic: Reaction to incoming magic within melee range; you intercept the magic with your left hand, attempting to absorb its power. Roll Fortitude against the spell's DC. On success, you gain Vitae equal to the spell's effect, and nullify its intended effect. On mixed success, choose one. On failure, you gain no Vitae and suffer the effect.\n  - Spellsteal: At-will, std, melee range; you use a variant of Absorb Magic on a spellcaster or active spell, \"stealing\" it. Roll Spellcraft vs DC; on success, you nullify the effect or steal an appropriate amount of magical energy from a caster, and gain a single, consumable use of that power (which requires whatever action would be normal to cast it). Can also target magic items, draining their power and effectiveness.\n- Clarity: At will, you can detect magical auras, discerning the identity and purpose of all effects that you are of sufficient level to have cast (even if not from the Witch list).\n  - True Seeing: You can see the true form of any creature whose is obscured by magical or mundane means, even if invisible.\n  - Arcane Sight: You know what spells and magical abilities a creature is capable of casting, if they are visible to you.\n- Ecstasy: Every time you work magic, you experience the bliss and divinity of the cosmos. In practical terms, this allows you to gain a benefit for each spell cast: heal yourself for light damage, remove a toxin or harmful magical effect from yourself (Spellcraft vs DC), or automatically remove any fear or negative emotion effect from yourself.\n- Friend of Magic: All magic that distinguishes between friend or foe (e.g. it says \"enemies suffer xyz or allies gain xyz\") has a 5% chance per level (minimum 25%) to treat you as whichever is more advantageous, regardless of caster's intent. All other hostile magic has a 1% chance per level (no minimum) to have no effect on you.\n\n\n\n\n# Powers\n\n# Pestilence\n\n1 action, touch or 60-ft, V/S, inst; you infect subject with a chosen disease. Diseases last 5 rounds; each application of the same disease refreshes the duration.\n- '''Blood Boil''': subject suffers light fire damage per round, and when struck for physical damage, causes a burst 1 inflicting light fire damage to enemies.\n- '''Frost Fever''': subject suffers light cold damage per round, and is *chilled* (Fort ends).\n- '''Shadow Plague''': subject suffers light necrotic damage per round, and is Weakened (half damage).\n\nMetamagic options:\n- For +1 mana, add an additional disease at casting time.\n- For +1 mana, you can modify the spell so that it spreads diseases from one target onto others within 2 squares (+1 mana to add +2 squares).\n\n# Transfusion\n\nSwift, touch; you transfer any amount of damage from subject to yourself, to a limit of the amount that would reduce you to 0 HP.\n\nReversed:\n\nStd, touch; you steal subject's life, transferring your damage to them, to a limit of the amount that would fully heal you, or the amount that would reduce them to 0, or heavy damage: whichever is lowest. They are allowed a Fort save for half damage.\n\n# Burning Blood\n\nWhen you have suffered damage, you can call upon the power of your own blood to deliver vengeance upon your enemies.\n\nStd, ranged; inflicts fire damage equal to the amount of damage you have suffered.\n- For +1 mana, change to cone 3, or add +3 squares to cone.\n- For +1 mana, change to burst 2, or add +2 squares to burst.\n\nFeat ideas:\n- Feat that lets you use someone else's blood (maybe not specific to this power)\n\n# Blood Calls to Blood\n\nEncounter, swift, medium range; you control subject's physical actions (Will ends). Requires subject's blood; any time a creature suffers physical damage, it spills blood upon the creature, the weapon, and the ground nearby.\n\n# Blood Rage\n\nRequires your own blood; grants scaling bonuses to damage and haste based on how damaged you are. You can let your own blood to make this happen. Rules TBD.\n\n# Ironguard\n\nYou become immune to iron-based weapons. They may as well be incorporeal. Rules TBD\n\n# Frozen Blood\n\nYou suffer no debilitation from being at or below 0 HP: no disabled, no dying, and no death. That is, until the spell ends.\n\n# Presence\n\nEvoke an emotional state in others in an emanation. Can buff or debuff. Rules TBD\n\n# Phantasm\n\nStd, ranged; you control what subject senses while you concentrate (Cha ends, but only if they realize the effect is happening; you can use Deception to fool them if your phantasm is suitably subtle).\n\n# Emotion\n\nEmotion: Single action, ranged; subject is affected by a single, powerful emotion. Choose one of the following\nCalm: Subject immediately ceases all action and contemplates life. Wisdom save ends; any hostility against target ends the effect. Can also use on an ally to nullify a negative emotion effect or berserker rage.\nDesire: Subject is overcome with desire for caster or another of caster's choice, undermining his judgment. Rules TBD.\nFear: Subject becomes frightened, ceasing all action but to flee and defend himself. Wisdom save ends after first round.\nResolve: Subject's will is hardened; he gains advantage to all saving throws for 1 minute.\nRage: Subject immediately becomes hostile to everyone. Wisdom save ends.\n\n# Mind Control\n\nMind Control: Single action, concentration, long range; you control subject's actions while he remains within Long range (Wisdom save ends, max one save per 10 minutes). Any hostile actions by your allies against subject negates the spell.\n\n## Soulgaze\n\n+ Soul Splint\n\n## Reanimate\n\nReanimate: 1 action, 60-ft, V/S, 5 rounds#### you animate one or more recently-dead (within the last hour) corpses (of humanoids or animals). The cost is one Mana per creature animated. You may control a maximum of 1 + 1 per 2 levels as a bonus action (60-ft range, language-dependent); any others act on your last command, or, lacking such command, act as crazed, starved, wild animals might. The traits of the animated dead are\n'''Undead:''' immune to death effects, energy drain, etc. Cannot be healed as living creatures would. Vulnerable to abilities that affect undead specifically.\n'''Clumsy:''' -2 to Dex and movement speed.\n'''Stupid:''' Int set to 5. They are barely able to understand the simplest of spoken commands, with the aid of gestures and nonverbal communication. They lose any spellcasting abilities, skills, feats, class features, and proficiencies. If wielding martial weapons, they are disadvantaged on attack rolls (but are fine with simple weapons).\n'''Doomed:''' At the end of the duration of the spell, they die once more, and cannot be raised again with Reanimate.\n\n## Necrosis\n\nNecrosis: Single action, medium range; part of subject's body dies, then grows into a new limb, head, or whatever is needed, which wields the subject's own strength against it and its allies. Each round, for 3 rounds, you may choose one of the subject's own maneuvers or spells and execute it, with the subject's own damage statistics.\n\n\n## Frost Block\n\n- 1 mana, std, ranged; subject is immobile, unable to act, and invulnerable, as all attacks strike the frost block first. The block has HP equal to a heavy damage roll. It is immune to frost damage and vulnerable to fire damage. On turn start, the creature inside, if warm-blooded, suffers light frost damage and reduces the ice block's HP by the same amount. They can, as a standard action, attempt to burst free by passing a Strength check against the spell's DC; on success, they inflict medium kinetic damage to the ice block.\n  - +1 Mana: +100% ice block HP\n  - +1 Mana: change cast time to reaction, target to self. Can end the effect as a free action.\n\n  ","bodyHtml":"<h1>Witch</h1>\n<p>What is a witch?

A hearthstone has a 1 hour cooldown.\n<ul>\n<li>Reversed: 10 minutes, reagent (one hearthstone); you destroy the hearthstone, and the hearth to which it is meant to teleport its user, negating the function of any other hearthstones connected to it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Create Greater Phylactery: 1 hour, reagent cost (1 gp plus a strong sympathetic component); as Create Phylactery, but requires the strongest of sympathetic components, such as a vial of fresh blood (no more than 5 minutes exposed at start of ritual) or a portion of subject's soul. Allows all uses of a standard phylactery, plus:\n<ul>\n<li>Transmit Weal or Woe: same as normal, except phylactery can suffer 5 &quot;hits&quot; before being destroyed.</li>\n<li>Steal Visage: same as normal, but does not destroy phylactery.</li>\n<li>Steal Spell: at-will; you may cast a spell that the subject knows, as if you knew it.\nMagnify Harm: constant; any harm you inflict upon subject directly (not through Transmit Weal or Woe) is increased in effectiveness by 50%.</li>\n<li>Domination: at-will, concentration; you may control subject's actions (Contest of Wills).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Spells</h1>\n<h1>Bindings</h1>\n<h1>Felicity</h1>\n<p>The path of the Witch is challenging. Upon realization of the reality of Chroma, a witch realizes she is more limited than other casters--or rather, she is simply aware of limitations they too possess, but are too naive to notice. This somewhat reduces the outright usefulness of magic, especially to an adventurer, who might, for intance, find frequent need for harmful magic.</p>\n<p>There is an advantage to this inconvenient knowledge. By understanding magic on a more fundamental level, witches find themselves in greater harmony with magic than other practitioners. The Felicity talents express this ability, granting advantages that reflect how magic itself tends to favor you, sometimes more so than its wielder.</p>\n<p>Some of these talents reserve Vitae, and some have Chroma requirements. Some have no requirements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Absorb Magic: Reaction to incoming magic within melee range; you intercept the magic with your left hand, attempting to absorb its power. Roll Fortitude against the spell's DC. On success, you gain Vitae equal to the spell's effect, and nullify its intended effect. On mixed success, choose one. On failure, you gain no Vitae and suffer the effect.\n<ul>\n<li>Spellsteal: At-will, std, melee range; you use a variant of Absorb Magic on a spellcaster or active spell, &quot;stealing&quot; it. Roll Spellcraft vs DC; on success, you nullify the effect or steal an appropriate amount of magical energy from a caster, and gain a single, consumable use of that power (which requires whatever action would be normal to cast it). Can also target magic items, draining their power and effectiveness.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Clarity: At will, you can detect magical auras, discerning the identity and purpose of all effects that you are of sufficient level to have cast (even if not from the Witch list).\n<ul>\n<li>True Seeing: You can see the true form of any creature whose is obscured by magical or mundane means, even if invisible.</li>\n<li>Arcane Sight: You know what spells and magical abilities a creature is capable of casting, if they are visible to you.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ecstasy: Every time you work magic, you experience the bliss and divinity of the cosmos. In practical terms, this allows you to gain a benefit for each spell cast: heal yourself for light damage, remove a toxin or harmful magical effect from yourself (Spellcraft vs DC), or automatically remove any fear or negative emotion effect from yourself.</li>\n<li>Friend of Magic: All magic that distinguishes between friend or foe (e.g. it says &quot;enemies suffer xyz or allies gain xyz&quot;) has a 5% chance per level (minimum 25%) to treat you as whichever is more advantageous, regardless of caster's intent. All other hostile magic has a 1% chance per level (no minimum) to have no effect on you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Powers</h1>\n<h1>Pestilence</h1>\n<p>1 action, touch or 60-ft, V/S, inst; you infect subject with a chosen disease. Diseases last 5 rounds; each application of the same disease refreshes the duration.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>'''Blood Boil''': subject suffers light fire damage per round, and when struck for physical damage, causes a burst 1 inflicting light fire damage to enemies.</li>\n<li>'''Frost Fever''': subject suffers light cold damage per round, and is <em>chilled</em> (Fort ends).</li>\n<li>'''Shadow Plague''': subject suffers light necrotic damage per round, and is Weakened (half damage).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Metamagic options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For +1 mana, add an additional disease at casting time.</li>\n<li>For +1 mana, you can modify the spell so that it spreads diseases from one target onto others within 2 squares (+1 mana to add +2 squares).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Transfusion</h1>\n<p>Swift, touch; you transfer any amount of damage from subject to yourself, to a limit of the amount that would reduce you to 0 HP.</p>\n<p>Reversed:</p>\n<p>Std, touch; you steal subject's life, transferring your damage to them, to a limit of the amount that would fully heal you, or the amount that would reduce them to 0, or heavy damage: whichever is lowest. They are allowed a Fort save for half damage.</p>\n<h1>Burning Blood</h1>\n<p>When you have suffered damage, you can call upon the power of your own blood to deliver vengeance upon your enemies.</p>\n<p>Std, ranged; inflicts fire damage equal to the amount of damage you have suffered.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For +1 mana, change to cone 3, or add +3 squares to cone.</li>\n<li>For +1 mana, change to burst 2, or add +2 squares to burst.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Feat ideas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Feat that lets you use someone else's blood (maybe not specific to this power)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Blood Calls to Blood</h1>\n<p>Encounter, swift, medium range; you control subject's physical actions (Will ends). Requires subject's blood; any time a creature suffers physical damage, it spills blood upon the creature, the weapon, and the ground nearby.</p>\n<h1>Blood Rage</h1>\n<p>Requires your own blood; grants scaling bonuses to damage and haste based on how damaged you are. You can let your own blood to make this happen. Rules TBD.</p>\n<h1>Ironguard</h1>\n<p>You become immune to iron-based weapons. They may as well be incorporeal. Rules TBD</p>\n<h1>Frozen Blood</h1>\n<p>You suffer no debilitation from being at or below 0 HP: no disabled, no dying, and no death. That is, until the spell ends.</p>\n<h1>Presence</h1>\n<p>Evoke an emotional state in others in an emanation. Can buff or debuff. Rules TBD</p>\n<h1>Phantasm</h1>\n<p>Std, ranged; you control what subject senses while you concentrate (Cha ends, but only if they realize the effect is happening; you can use Deception to fool them if your phantasm is suitably subtle).</p>\n<h1>Emotion</h1>\n<p>Emotion: Single action, ranged; subject is affected by a single, powerful emotion. Choose one of the following\nCalm: Subject immediately ceases all action and contemplates life. Wisdom save ends; any hostility against target ends the effect. Can also use on an ally to nullify a negative emotion effect or berserker rage.\nDesire: Subject is overcome with desire for caster or another of caster's choice, undermining his judgment. Rules TBD.\nFear: Subject becomes frightened, ceasing all action but to flee and defend himself. Wisdom save ends after first round.\nResolve: Subject's will is hardened; he gains advantage to all saving throws for 1 minute.\nRage: Subject immediately becomes hostile to everyone. Wisdom save ends.</p>\n<h1>Mind Control</h1>\n<p>Mind Control: Single action, concentration, long range; you control subject's actions while he remains within Long range (Wisdom save ends, max one save per 10 minutes). Any hostile actions by your allies against subject negates the spell.</p>\n<h2>Soulgaze</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Soul Splint</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Reanimate</h2>\n<p>Reanimate: 1 action, 60-ft, V/S, 5 rounds#### you animate one or more recently-dead (within the last hour) corpses (of humanoids or animals). The cost is one Mana per creature animated. You may control a maximum of 1 + 1 per 2 levels as a bonus action (60-ft range, language-dependent); any others act on your last command, or, lacking such command, act as crazed, starved, wild animals might. The traits of the animated dead are\n'''Undead:''' immune to death effects, energy drain, etc. Cannot be healed as living creatures would. Vulnerable to abilities that affect undead specifically.\n'''Clumsy:''' -2 to Dex and movement speed.\n'''Stupid:''' Int set to 5. They are barely able to understand the simplest of spoken commands, with the aid of gestures and nonverbal communication. They lose any spellcasting abilities, skills, feats, class features, and proficiencies. If wielding martial weapons, they are disadvantaged on attack rolls (but are fine with simple weapons).\n'''Doomed:''' At the end of the duration of the spell, they die once more, and cannot be raised again with Reanimate.</p>\n<h2>Necrosis</h2>\n<p>Necrosis: Single action, medium range; part of subject's body dies, then grows into a new limb, head, or whatever is needed, which wields the subject's own strength against it and its allies. Each round, for 3 rounds, you may choose one of the subject's own maneuvers or spells and execute it, with the subject's own damage statistics.</p>\n<h2>Frost Block</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>1 mana, std, ranged; subject is immobile, unable to act, and invulnerable, as all attacks strike the frost block first. The block has HP equal to a heavy damage roll. It is immune to frost damage and vulnerable to fire damage. On turn start, the creature inside, if warm-blooded, suffers light frost damage and reduces the ice block's HP by the same amount. They can, as a standard action, attempt to burst free by passing a Strength check against the spell's DC; on success, they inflict medium kinetic damage to the ice block.\n<ul>\n<li>+1 Mana: +100% ice block HP</li>\n<li>+1 Mana: change cast time to reaction, target to self. Can end the effect as a free action.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n","metadata":null,"transformedMetadata":"default transform"},{"name":"index","contents":"Powers are abilities that are supernatural or extraordinary in nature that make you...well, more powerful.\r\n\r\nSpells are an obvious type of power, but there are others, such as passive or constant effects, supernatural objects or gear, or even the effect of your legacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nMechanically, powers are simple: you gain 1 per level, plus 1 at character creation (i.e. level \"0\").
