{"name":"Feats","contents":"Every PC gets 1 feat per level, plus a bonus feat at character creation (i.e. level \"0\").\n\nEach [Power Source](./Powers/) has its own list of feats you can choose that go well with that power source. All of the below are also valid choices.\n\n\n# Fighter Feats\nEach time you select one of the below feats, you also gain:\n- +3 HP/level\n- +1 Attack, Fortitude\n- +0.75 Reflex\n- +0.5 Fortitude, Spellcraft, Concentration, Willpower\n\nFeat list:\n- [Action Surge](): once per short rest, you can take an additional action of any type.\n  - Maximum Effort: you may use Action Surge more than once per short rest, but each time you suffer Strain to an appropriate ability score (Str, Dex, or Con). Strain means that you are disadvantaged with that ability score until you've either had a long rest, or a short rest with treatment from a healer (Medicine DC 15).\n- [Improved Critical](): add +2 to threat range with all weapon attacks. (stackable)\n- [Remarkable Athlete](): You can add half your proficiency bonus (round up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you make that doesn't already use your proficiency bonus. In addition, when you make a running long jump, the distance you can cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Strength modifier.\n- [Indomitable](): Once per short rest, you can reroll any failed save.\n- [Survivor](): At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points left. You don't gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.\n- [Weapon Specialization](): Choose a specific type of weapon. With that weapon, you gain an additional martial weapon trait normally not available to it.\n\nOther ideas: whichever maneuvers don't make it into core combat rules.\n\n\n# Rogue Feats\nEach time you select one of the below feats, you also gain:\n- +2 HP/level\n- +1 Attack, Reflex\n- +0.75 Fortitude\n- +0.5 Spellcraft, Concentration, Willpower\n\nFeat list:\n- [Feint](): as normal melee attack, but roll Deception vs Perception first; on success, the enemy thinks your first attack is the real one, and any reactions or defenses expended count for the fake attack. Then, follow up with a real attack.\n- [Skill Expertise](): Choose any nonmagical skill; you can roll this skill with advantage.\n- [Sneak Attack](): when attacking an opponent, if you have advantage, your attack inflicts bonus medium damage.\n- [Evasion](): reaction to any damaging or debilitating attack; roll Acrobatics, DC 10 + 5 per square of distance needed to be clear of the attack. On success, you leap to the nearest safe square, avoiding the attack.\n- [Sap](): when attacking an opponent with a bludgeoning weapon, if you have advantage, you can stun them instead of inflicting damage (Fort ends).\n- [Kick](): reaction, melee range, triggered by an enemy casting a spell or using similar focus-demanding action; you make an unarmed attack. If you hit and inflict damage, subject must pass a Concentration check to keep their action.\n- [Silver Tongue](): requires proficiency in Persuasion. As a one-minute action, you use your Persuasion skill to charm a humanoid subject. If they fail a Wisdom save, they suffer the same effect as Charm Person. You can use this ability once per long rest, although if you take Expertise in Persuasion, you may use it twice per long rest.\n- [Hide in Plain Sight](): TBD\n\n\n# Practitioner\nEach time you select one of the below feats, you also gain:\n- +1 HP/level\n- +1 Spellcraft, Concentration, Willpower\n- +0.5 Fortitude, Reflex\n\nFeat list:\n- [Wield Spell](): Using a free hand, you can select a defensive spell that you are \"wielding\". Its action type changes to reaction, trigger by incoming damage or debilitation to yourself or a nearby ally.\n- [Energy Specialization](): choose one magical damage type (fire, force, psychic, etc). Gain +1 bonus damage per die with this type.\n- [Permanency](): Choose a Concentration spell that affects you that you can cast. This is now active at all times.\n- [Spell Turning](): When you successfully counter a spell, you turn it back on its caster.\n- [Master of Shaping](): When casting an area spell, you can choose to remove up to 1 square from its area per point of Int bonus.\n- [Innate Power](): Choose any spell you know that has an associated cost (e.g Corruption, Focus, Vitae, etc). You may manifest this power once per short rest without said cost.\n- [Peculiar Element](): Invent a new damage type, that is able to be described as a combination of two types. For instance, you might inflict Blackfire damage, which is a combination of Fire and Necrotic. When inflicting damage with a spell of either type, the damage is of both types; the effect of this is always what is most advantageous to you (for instance, if you inflict Fire/Lightning damage, and the enemy is immune to Fire but vulnerable to Lightning, they are vulnerable to the all of the damage you dealt).\n- [Chain Spell](): you can cast a single-target spell in such a way that it repeats its effect on multiple targets. This is both expensive and difficult to accomplish. Each time you hit with the spell, you can re-target another target within 1 square per Int bonus of the current target, if they haven't already been hit with this casting of the spell. Each subsequent attempt has the same cost as if you cast the spell fresh (but no action cost). If you miss a target, you cannot chain off them. Maximum number of \"bounces\" is equal to your Int bonus.\n- [Contingent Spell](): you can cast a spell in such a way that it does not take effect immediately, but lays dormant in a spell focus that you carry or wear. You decide what will trigger it (e.g. you are about to take damage, you are about to be counterspelled, etc). The spell becomes a reaction with that trigger. All costs are normal. Maximum contingent spells on your person at a time is 1 per Wis bonus.\n- [Dominus](): You are adept at magically controlling minions. The default ability to control any sort of summoned, risen, or conjured minion is however many were conjured by a single casting. With this ability, you can increase that limit to 1 per Charisma bonus. This does not confer any ability to summon multiple minions at a time, or even to summon them at all--you must possess such ability already.\n- [Spell Focus](): You create an item that, when wielded, helps you focus your concentration on spellcasting. When casting a Concentration spell, you can choose to devote the item to the spell. This allows you to maintain the spell as if you were concentrating on it, but your actual concentration remains available if you need it for another spell or action.\n- [Keen Spell](): gain +2 to critical threat range with spells.","bodyHtml":"<p>Every PC gets 1 feat per level, plus a bonus feat at character creation (i.e. level &quot;0&quot;).</p>\n<p>Each <a href=\"./Powers/\">Power Source</a> has its own list of feats you can choose that go well with that power source.
