[{"name":"Legacy (working document)","contents":"# New version, in brief\n\nEveryone gets a bonus feat and a bonus power at level 0. This is useful for establishing legacy abilities. Further abilities must be purchased using feats and powers gained through leveling.\n\nTo gain a legacy, you opt in to a chosen legacy's basic state, which is typically level-neutral (any advantages it grants are offset by disadvantages). You can choose to have no legacy. You can have multiple, but only at the DM's discretion.\n\nSome legacies have \"negative\" powers which impart disadvatanges, but allow you to select more powers in kind. These can be selected at character creation, or when leveling up and selecting new Legacy powers.\n\nQuick example:\n- The Vampire legacy grants:\n  - Ability score bonuses (net positive)\n  - Undead traits (minor negative)\n  - Vulnerability to sunlight and magical thresholds (major negative)\n  - Blood mechanic (net neutral)\n  - Access to a variety of feats and powers\n- The Chosen One legacy grants:\n  - Ability score bonuses (net positive)\n  - A guiding force NPC, magic item, voice in your head, etc (neutral)\n  - Obligations to perform a sacred duty (net negative)\n\n\n\n\n\n# Old, class-based version\n\nAll D&D races gone. As is the word \"race\".\n\nEach level represents either training or innate ability. I suppose you could say there are two Classes in the game, one representing each.\n\nLevels of training grant 1 Feat, as mentioned.\n\nInnate ability should total 0 at 1st level, but it can do so by balancing useful abilities with disadvantages.\n\nExamples:\n\n# Sylvans\n- (+1 level) gain +2 to two ability scores or +4 to one ability score.\n- (+1 level) gain the ability to Fey Step (recharge 33%, move, ranged, teleport within line of sight)\n- (+1 level) gain the ability to Charm (recharge 33%, std, range; subject is charmed, Cha ends, ends automatically or fails immediately if you or obvious ally is hostile)\n- (+1 level) gain the ability to summon a minor animal to aid you (e.g. rat, owl, fox)\n- (+2 level) gain a powerful animal or plant like form you can shift into for a limited time\n- (-1 level) you physically cannot speak a direct lie. You can exaggerate, or mislead, or use weasel worlds, but direct, factual lies are impossible.\n- (-2 levels) you are obligated to honor any deal, bargain, or promise made, even if it is not in your favor.\n- (-3 levels) you are vulnerable to iron and iron-based weapon attacks. You cannot wield iron weapons or wear iron armor.\n\n# Netherkind\n- (+1 level) gain +2 to two ability scores or +4 to one ability score.\n- (+1 level) Resist (necrotic)\n- (-1 level) Vulnerable (radiant)\n- (+2 levels) Blood Drain: you have a bite attack inflicting 1d4 Con damage. Drained blood can reduce any Con damage you might have, or otherwise grant temporary Con (up to 10 higher than normal).\n- (-2 levels) Blood Addiction: you must feed on blood to survive. Your subjects must be of the same phenotype as you (e.g., in most cases, natural humanoids). You lose 2 points of Con every day simply existing. Food is tasty, but does not slake your blood hunger. You must have the Blood Drain ability in order to feed. If your Con drops below 10, you must pass a Wis save (DC = 10 + amount Con is below normal) every time you have the opportunity to feed, if you do not wish to. If your Con drops 10 points below normal, or below 4, you lose control of your character, as they drop all inhibitions and pursue feeding until max Con is reached.\n- (+2 levels) Regeneration: (requires Blood Drain) At the beginning of each round, even if you are otherwise unable to take actions, you can choose to exchange Con points to remove Wounds. Every 2 Con points removes 1 Wound per level. This automatically stabilizes you if you were unstable, and allows you to re-roll your Con check to determine if you are disabled or merely bloody. If dying, this ability does not restore your ability to act, unless it reduces your Wounds to 0.\n- (-2 levels) Sunlight Vulnerability: Each round you spend in natural sunlight, you suffer 10 Wounds. This occurs if any portion of your body is exposed to the light.\n- (-1 levels) Holy Ward: You cannot cross the threshold of a sanctified place or the home of a mortal without invitation. If you find yourself inside one, you must spend all actions to exit as quickly as possible. If a living creature presents you with a holy symbol in which they possess true faith, you cannot approach closer to them voluntarily.\n\nOther vampire abilities are generally +1 level.\n\n\n\n# The World\n\nLike 3e, this system has an Implied Setting. Effectively, that means it has everything a normal setting has except a map. More specifically:\n- It has \"races\" (though not the traditional ones), and rules for making your own\n- It has places (interesting towns, dungeons, ruins, etc), but you decided where they are\n- It has a few gods and other powers, and rules for making your own\n- It has a prevailing magic system that explains magic users, powerful beings, etc\n- It has a socioeconomic and political reality that allows for adventurers\n- It has a magic item economy\n- It has a medieval fantasy aesthetic, with a few things from other settings (i.e. artifice, automata), but not full-blown Steampunk (but it can be)\n- Everything in it is portable to other worlds\n\n\n# People\nThe words \"race\", \"races\", and \"racial\" shall not appear in the work. The section that describes the innate abilities of PCs and NPCs shall be called People, and it will explain all of the People in the setting.\n\n> We have heard of worlds where magic hides, and must be teased out through rigorous study, and purchased dearly from the world's life force. We have seen visages of worlds where magic flows too freely, and is tamed and weaponized, perverted in its purpose, until all life is drained from the world by one means or another. This is not our world.\n> \n> Our world sits in the balance between Aether and Nether. Above, the Aether stirs, ever creative, blossoming into existence from nothing. In its pure form, it is power, and potential, and all things--but far too potent for mortals. The Aether is the realm of the Divine. But Aether does not last forever. It decays--some say it evolves--but the transition is permanent. Aether becomes Fire, or Earth, or Life. It becomes the air we breathe, the water we drink. It becomes the complex elements that form the biosphere, and the simple energies that make the elements vital. And, at long last, when matter and energy have expired, they decay once more, descending into the Nether, from which they will never return.\n> \n> The many elements and energies of our world keep it vital and diverse. Minerals, plants, and animals exist in abundance, all aligning with one element or another, or several, or even an ever-changing preference. And so, too, does intelligent and sentient life form its clades and niches. The many peoples of our world all have a favorite element or two, or a guiding energy that unites them. The Sylvans, full of Life, are similar to the many animals and plants of the surface world, but with the advantage of speech, tools, and complex society. The Elementals dwell where pure elemental energies ebb--in the earth's crust, in pools of fire, in deepest ocean, amidst the clouds, etc.\n> \n> It is even said that, beyond our world, others peoples live similar lives. The Devi are the peoples of Aether, kin to the gods themselves. Below, the Netherkin scrape some sort of existence together in a realm of eternal decay. Some clever folk have even engineered new energies, distinct from those of nature: Artifice makes wonderful toys, and terrible weapons, and even a new sort of people: the Automata. Similarly, not all people agree on how magic ought to be used, and some have used it--intentionally or otherwise--to warp natural people and creatures into something nature never intended: the Divergent.\n> \n> But people are as people do. No one element or energy is right, and none is wrong. People do good, and bad, and they change their minds. No one sits in judgment. There are godly beings, every one with a story to tell of their exploits, their virtues and vices, but there is no consensus as to who is right and who is wrong, for people believe what they wish to believe. Religions are as numerous as any other invention of people--they are an attempt to understand a Universe which is more complex, beautiful, and awesome than any work of words has ever captured. There is more mystery in the Earth and the Heavens than may ever be explored.\n\n\nGods:\n- Each ethnic group has a \"pantheon\" of sorts. Each pantheon is an entirely different approach to religion.\n- Sylvan gods are beings like Wolf, Eagle, Bear, etc, and a more powerful and distant class such as Sky, Moon, and Mother (the world itself). They don't do a lot of judging. The religion believes in constant reincarnation, without a karmic system--after all, natural is self-balancing. Sometimes you're the predator, sometimes you're the prey.\n- Elemental gods are simply the most powerful elemental beings in a given area. There is no separate world in which elementals exist. Elementals are also ageless, and are absorbed into their element when they die (preferably), so there is no afterlife. Sadly, many Elementals are destroyed in order to harvest elemental crystals. This is frowned upon.\n\n\nHumans:\n- More sort of the \"mutts\" of the world. Some consider themselves \"pure\", but the reality is they are the genetic \"average\" of all the more extreme forms of humanoid out there. Different stories are told of origins--some even prefer that humans arrived from elsewhere, perhaps via lost magicks or technology--a reason for some to pursue such knowledge with zeal and even abandon.\n\n\n# Magic\n\nSo Aether becomes elements and energy. More specifically, all those twinkly white things in the sky are explosions of Aether, pure and white, devolving into matter and energy spewed in every direction. Some time ago, perhaps at the direction of gods, this world was woven together from many elements and energies. Other worlds may even exist, somewhere out in the Cosmos.\n\nBut what is magic, then? Well, magic is just a continuum of possibility in a Universe where more energies exist than in ours. While thermal and electromagnetic potential exist in both Universes, only in this one does pure Fire, Air, or Life energy bind itself to matter. And thus, said energies can be coaxed apart, and formed into something useful.\n\nThe most traditional magicks are probably those of the Sylvan and Elemental peoples, at least before the increase in the complexity of civilization over the last few thousand years. For long eons prior, Sylvans and Elementals practiced traditional arts that could be called \"magic\". \n\nSylvan \"magic\" is mainly incorporated into their forms, which can grow and evolve in power as they become more potent. The more esoteric and \"magicky\" of their arts are those involving the Spirit Realm, a coterminous space (or an extension of existing space that others cannot see). Within the context of ancient Sylvan life, this might not even be considered magic at all--although these days, only a small few practice the ancient ways.\n\nElemental magic is a bit more obvious, albeit restricted to the spaces and times where the energy abounds. Within nodes of elemental power, Elementals can create many effects in line with the energy they are using. Far away from such sources, they must draw on their own internal energy, which can diminish them quickly.\n\nSo is that it? What of robed wizards animating brooms? Broom-riding witches brewing potions in cauldrons?\n\nWell, apart from things that are decidedly *not* spellcasting such as Alchemy, such magic definitely exists, and is the result of careful study and experimentation by many generations of clever practitioners (of varying ethical persuasions).\n\nThe mechanisms by which a Sylvan might call upon natural power to change their form, or by which an Elemental might cause Earth to roil or Fire to blaze, were once mysterious. Through study, practitioners have made them less so. Given that all elements and energies have a natural affinity, it becomes possible to create tools to help create overt magical effects.\n\nFor instance, a tree is a fairly advanced form of Life energy, so a branch of that tree can be used to manipulate said energy. Staves and wands are a common sight among those who wish to wield the energies of Life. Elementalism is really quite simple: earth is earth, water is water, etc. If one wishes to control fire, one needs some fire to control. Older schools of elementalism deal exclusively with manipulating what already exists in nature, and is at hand. In times past, fire elementalists would not be caught outside without a burning brazier, firebrand, or some such source of their preferred element.\n\nBut we mustn't forget that all things come from Aether, which means there exists a primeval source for any desired energy. Perhaps the greatest discovery of the magical arts--certainly the most disruptive--was that the Aether, long known not to have any direct affinity with any known physical object, does in fact have affinity with complex thought-forms: words, symbols, mathematics, geometry, etc. Careful, exhaustive study of the appearance of abstract logic in nature (e.g. hexagons in beehives, crystalline structures in rock, the golden ratio, etc) eventually yielded the unifying theorem: how abstract, otherwise unreal structures that seem only to exist in the mind ultimately link with the Aether above. And so, mages learned to call upon Aether to create their own energies.\n\n(This has been the subject of much criticism)","bodyHtml":"<h1>New version, in brief</h1>\n<p>Everyone gets a bonus feat and a bonus power at level 0.

Legacies use a point system, wherein:\n- Every PC gets at least 4 Legacy Points.\n  - This is a \"0-level\" legacy. If starting at levels higher than 1st, you can take a more powerful legacy:\n  - Each level for which you do not receive a Feat and a Power as normal grants 4 more Legacy Points.\n  - This option is not available when leveling up; Feats and Powers do exist to enhance your legacy after character creation.\n- Abilities can cost any number of points, including zero or a negative number.\n  - Negative points, naturally, decrease your Legacy Point total, allowing you to take more positive-cost abilities to reach the limit.\n  - You cannot exceed a total of -4 with negative abilities, even if starting at a higher level than 1st.\n\n\n# General\n\n# General Advantages\n- Strong/Dextrous/Tough/Smart/Wise/Charismatic (1): You gain a +2 racial bonus to the appropriate ability score.\n\n# General Penalties\n- Hollow Bones (-1): Suffer -1 to Str and Con, reduce weight by 20%. You are rather lightweight as a result, suffering -1 per die of falling damage. Stackable, although the weight reduction is multiplicative (80%, 64%, 51%, 40%). Goes great with Avian builds.\n\n\n\n# Sylvan\n\n# General\n- Wild Step (1): Ignore difficult terrain penalties from natural terrain of any sort.\n- Scent (2): You gain the Scent ability. In a radius of 6 squares (12 downwind), you gain awareness of all creatures on the same plane regardless of concealment, and as an action you can pinpoint the square they occupy. You have the ability to identify and track scents as well as a bloodhound.\n\n\n# Plantoid\n- Photosynthesis (0): You have green skin. You gain energy from sunlight, rather than from eating. You still need water, and occasional vitamins and minerals (about as often as a normal human would). You need at least 8 hours of sun exposure per day to feel \"fed\". Penalties include...whatever the fuck penalties exist for not eating enough, as if anyone even thought of that. TBI\n- Underwater Native (0): You have a swim speed of 6, and you can breathe underwater. You can also breathe above water (because otherwise this ability would be terrible). However, you cannot stay out of the water indefinitely. You need at least 8 hours of \"water time\" per day. Outside of natural bodies of water, a bath or pool is ideal, but there are also conceivable magical or technological items to recirculate water over you, or even to provide a water-tight suit (sort of a reverse scuba gear) that keeps you hydrated 24/7.\n- Glider (2): you have a pair of wings which you can use to glide and slow fall. You can improve your flight at later levels using feats/powers.\n- Flier (5): You have a fly speed equal to your walking speed. You cannot hover.\n\n# Boreal\n- Brachiation (1): gain a brachiation speed equal to your walking speed.\n\n# Essential Abilities\n\n- Plantoid: You gain energy from sunlight, you don't need food to live (although you need vitamins and minerals occasionally). Abilities TBD\n- Aquatic Native: Your native environment is underwater. You can breathe underwater and have a swim speed. You cannot stay out of water forever, although you can breathe in air for a short time. You need to be able to rest in water once per long rest or so. TBI\n- Avian: Choose one phenotype:\n  - Flier: you have wings instead of arms. You have a native fly speed, but suffer -4 to Str and Con due to hollow bones and a lightweight build. Your wings end in fingers nimble enough to cast spells, use weapons, etc.\n\n\n# Elemental\n\n# Earth\n- Earthen Skin (2): Gain an armor bonus equal to your Con bonus plus half your level, and a Fortification bonus of the same amount.\n- Earthen Body (4): You are entirely made of stone. You are immune to disease and poison, and Resist 50% (critical damage). You do not have to eat organic food to live (although you do not have to take Lithovore--you can if you desire).\n- Lithovore (1): You do not eat organic material. Instead, you eat metal and stone. An amount of stone equal to about 1% of your weight will satisfy you for a day. If you eat a sufficient quantity of extraordinary or magical materials (e.g. magic weapons or armor), you gain powerful bonuses. TBI\n- Stone Fist (1): Your unarmed attacks inflict heavy kinetic damage (two-handed) or medium kinetic damage (one-handed). They can be used to parry.\n- Minor Stonemorph (2): You can change your body in minor ways. Examples: turn your hand into a weapon or shield, turn your legs into a turret, retract your head into your body, etc. TBI\n- Major Stonemorph (5): You can completely modify your form, as long as you aren't changing your overall volume or mass. Example: turn into a wall of stone, a stone staircase, a (somewhat ineffienct) boat, etc. TBI\n\n\n# Water\n- Aquamorph: \n\n\n\n\n# Netherkin\n\nA widely varying category, what ties Netherkin together is that they are separated from the universe of \"positive energy\", i.e. energy coming from sunlight, organic digestion, elemental convection, etc. Instead, they subsist on \"negative energy\", which is a popular misnomer, although the alternatives are not much better (e.g. \"parasite\"). Netherkin consume energy from \"positive energy\" beings in order to survive. There are as many ways to do this as their are phenotypes--some drink blood, some drain souls, some sap mental energy, some devour memories--that's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThey should not be described as \"undead\", as, more so than any other factor, that word has lost all meaning. They are animate, they are conscious, they have minds, they have bodies (except the incorporeal ones, but even so), they can cease to exist, they can even be restored to function after ceasing to exist, given the right magic. In what way are they not \"alive\"? Nobody has defined the term well. The fact that they subsist on positive energy, and cannot generate it on their own, is a much clearer delination than any other. It is unique to their kind.\n\nEvery Netherkin must take an ability that explains how they get their energy (although feel free to take more than one). It is simply not possible for them to survive by eating and drinking, or soaking up sunlight, or bathing in elemental energy. If that were possible, they wouldn't be Netherkin, they'd be any of the other many Legacy options.\n\nThere is something inherently magical about devouring positive energy. It is not something that simple physics and chemistry can explain. The energy a human can get from drinking another human's blood is pretty miniscule--the energy a Hemovore gets from just a few second's feeding is vastly more than a normal human can absorb in the largest feast after hours of digestion. Apart from explanations involving nuclear decay or mass-energy conversion--which this Legacy type does not use--it is clearly not the physical energy of their \"food\" that is being absorbed.\n\nConsequently, Netherkin generally have very powerful physical abilities derived from the excess energy they consume. Their forms are able to store and utilize more energy than a human possibly could. Thus, their essential abilities tend to come with many advantages, countered by a great many disadvantages. An effort is made to keep both to a minimum, so the PC can customize beyond that minimum, but certain advantages are considered essential. For example: a vampire must be able to drink blood, and must be vulnerable to sunlight and holy energy. They don't all have to summon wolves, turn into mist, resurrect themselves in a coffin, etc etc.\n\n\n# Hemovore (4 points)\n- Drain Blood (0)\n  - Drink Blood\n  - Blood score\n  - Feeding frenzy (when low on blood, become stronger, but it's hard to resist feeding indiscriminately; when critically low, you lose control entirely)\n  - Opt-in digestive system (2): no need to eat/drink, but you can do so without harm (doesn't actually sustain you).
