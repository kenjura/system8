And *detect magic*? All the stuff practitioners should have, but aren't about to sink an entire power on it? How do they get these abilities?\n\nConsidering the archetypal characters, there seems to be a three-way tradeoff. That is, you have a given amount to invest into three categories:\n- Pure caster\n- Monster/enhanced\n- Exceptional fighter/rogue/etc\n\nBut it's not quite so simple. System 8 explicitly doesn't let you trade away powers; you don't have to have spell-like abilities, but you have to have something: super strength, uncanny luck, even if it's not from your blood, but from a cool item or something. It's essential to maintain some sort of balance.\n\nThis would seem to imply that there are really only two \"classes\" per se:\n- Pure Caster\n- Innate Power (monster, enhanced, cool item, etc)\n\nSo who is good at fighting? Well, melee attacks or whatever aren't really on this spectrum. Whatever normal HP, ACs, attack and damage rolls, etc that a level X caster can achieve, a level X innate can use their power to easily overmatch them. Training should matter, too, of course, but it seems like the job is mostly taken care of by ability scores. The true \"glass cannon\" style of pure caster will entirely neglect their physical stats and be rubbish at physical combat, whereas an innate power user should have little use for most of the mental stats and will necessarily have more focus in the physical ones (if not more ability score points overall due to said innate power).\n\nThis doesn't suit a 3.5 base very well. Two classes isn't a great look for d20, especially since neither fits any of the in-between abilities like Reflex. It might work with a 5e base somewhat better, where we just let people pick their ability scores as normal, and let proficiency separate the level bands. Maybe we can borrow something from PF2 and have different levels of proficiency (proficient, expert, etc).\n\nSo what does this look like? Let's talk specifics.\n\n\n# The \"Classes\"\n\nThere are really only two, but we'll pretend there are more by shifting the label of \"class\" down to the level of subclass. Thus:\n- Practitioners\n  - Invoker\n  - Elementalist\n  - Thaumaturge\n  - Arcanist\n  - Psion\n- Monsters\n  - Vampire\n  - Elemental\n  - Undead\n  - Sylvan\n  - etc\n- Innate\n\n\nFuck, no. It doesn't work. What if you're an innate power user who uses Invocation bindings? Why have separate classes for Elemental and Elementalist?\n\nWell, the other approach would seem to be:\n\n# Classes and Powers\n\nClasses describe training, skills, experience, hard work, knowledge, etc. Powers are cool supernatural things you can do. They are separate game mechanics.\n\nA power is something like \"Fireball\". Maybe you can make a fireball because you're a wizard who has studied magic for years and knows the arcane symbols and words to evoke one. Maybe you can do so because you're a sorcerer and fire is in your blood; you don't have to think about it, magic just comes out. Maybe you can do so because you're literally a fire elemental, and making a fireball is as natural for you as throwing a punch is for a human. Either way, it's a 20-ft radius burst that does medium fire damage, and costs 1 power slot on your character sheet.\n\nBut that other stuff? The difference between erudite wizards, innate sorcerers, and monsters? That's what classes are for.\n\nClasses, and some of the abilities they grant:\n\n\n## Practitioner\n\nThe classic \"pure caster\". Count on high mana, the ability to detect magic, dispel, counterspell, metamagic, feats to modify and augment your powers, creating items to enhance spellcasting, etc.\n\nFocuses on the three mental ability scores:\n- Int is useful for crafting spells, making up new modifiers for a spell on the fly, identifying and countering enemy spells, etc\n- Wis is useful for endurance, and controls your Mana attribute\n- Cha is for raw damage and contests of will\n\n\n## Gifted\n\nSome people are just born with gifts. Maybe you're stronger or faster than you ought to be. Maybe you have an innate magical ability. This is a relatively simple class that grants bonuses that most adventurers would find useful, such as:\n- ability boosts\n- bonuses to defense\n- bonuses to natural attacks\n- innate magical abilities, especially passive ones\n\n\n\n## Monster\n\nSimilar to Gifted, but usually with a distinct flavor and more power, but also significant disadvantages, such as Vampire or Werewolf.\n\n\n\n\n# Class Skills\n\nWell, that's all well and good. But maybe skills are the answer. Not sure how to balance them all yet, but many of the core abilities work fine as skills. For example:\n\n\n## Thaumaturgy\n\nUses:\n- create and use phylactery\n- detect vestigia / match vestigium to caster\n\n\n## Invocation\n\n- Detect planar alignment\n- Magic circle\n- Summon outsider\n- Command outsider\n- Banish outsider\n\n## Arcana\n\n- Bind magic into symbols, items, words\n- Learn from other practitioner's arcana\n\n## Psionics\n\n- Achieve mental focus\n- Defend your mind against intrusion\n- Open yourself to psychic impressions\n- Organize your thoughts; identify intrusive or foreign thoughts\n- Cleanse yourself of mental impurities\n- Psychic chirurgery\n\n\n## Spellcraft\n- Cast ritual spell\n- Identify spell (what does it do, how to counter it)\n- Modify spell as you cast it (spell stunt)\n\n## Concentration\n- Resist corruption\n- Resist interruption\n- Keep control of spell during ritual casting\n\n## Willpower\n- Dominate outsider\n- Win contest of wills\n- Resist mental intrusion\n\n\n\n## Proficiency bonuses\nYou might ask, how do you roll these crazy skills? Is Arcana Int based? Cha? Wis? Which is which?\n\nWell, it's time for skills to part ways with the concept of permanent ability score assignments. Fact is, skills represent training, not fundamental talent. Thus, they provide the \"training\" portion of the roll, and ability scores provide the \"talent\" portion. There's no reason they have to marry one particular score.\n\nFor example, a selection of Invocation's uses:\n- Detect Planar Alignment: roll a Wisdom check (add your Invocation proficiency) to detect the planar alignment of a creature of spell. Any creature native to another plane, or any magical effect they produce (whether personally or invoked by a mortal proxy) carries a signature of that plane, which you can identify with a successful check.\n- Summon outsider: name a specific outsider, or a class of similar ones (such as \"imp\" or \"succubus\"). You must defeat the outsider in an opposed Charisma check (add your Invocation proficiency bonus).\n- Resist Corruption: whenever the DM attempts to invoke your Corruption to make you act against your wishes, you can roll a Wisdom check (with Invocation proficiency bonus) to negate the action.\n\nSimilarly, a selection from the Melee skill:\n- Attack with a heavy, two-handed weapon: roll Strength + Melee proficiency. This sets the DC for the enemy's defense roll.\n- Attack with a light, one-handed weapon: roll Dexterity + Melee proficiency. This set the DC for the enemy's defense roll.\n\nMic fucking dropped.\n\n\n### Actual Proficiency Bonuses\n\nA few things:\n- There is a baseline. 5e had one, obv. 4e's was 1/2 level. Something like that.\n- The initial bump from \"not proficient\" to \"proficient\" is significant. Maybe +4 or +5.\n- There could be multiple levels, a la PF2 (or certain versions of S7). One such take:\n  - Proficient: +4\n  - Expert: +7\n  - Master: +9\n  - Legend: +10\n  - With additional benefits beyond just the numeric bonus.","bodyHtml":"<h1>8.1</h1>\n<h1>Basics</h1>\n<p>Considering a change to basic formulas.

Maybe +4 or +5.</li>\n<li>There could be multiple levels, a la PF2 (or certain versions of S7).
