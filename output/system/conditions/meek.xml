<contents>Meek is a state where a creature's Charisma is severely weakened. They suffer:
- Disadvantage to all Charisma rolls
- On turn start, if they have suffered any damage, they become demoralized. There is a 50% chance they spend their turn attempting to seek safety, rather than continuing to fight.
- Their maximum Mana is reduced to 50%. Track current Mana as Max Mana - Mana consumed.
- When using powers, they cannot use abilities or modifiers that require spending any extra Mana above the normal cost.</contents>
