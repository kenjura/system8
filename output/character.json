While helpful, these are but aids to master the mental control needed to to envison *formae*, which form the basis of spells.\n\n*Formae* (the plural) each describe a fundamental magical effect, such as opening a portal, or creating light, or transforming an object's shape. To do more complex things, it is possible (through even greater mental effort) to combine multiple *formae* at the same time. A spell comprised of a single *forma* is described as one of the \"First Order\", whereas one comprised of multiple is \"Second Order\". \"Third Order\" does not describe three *formae*, but instead describes a combination of multiple forma, at least one of which is Second-Order. One can imagine Fifth Order spells as quite complex indeed.\n\n+ You do not use an Energy mechanic to cast spells. Rather, you roll skill checks, the DC of which is based on the difficulty of the *formae* and *adjectivae* involved; failure on these checks can cause negative consequences.\n+ By default, when casting spells, you use *mnemonics*, which are mental aids in the form of geometric symbols, arcane words, gestures, etc. These are not themselves the components of magic, but rather devices that aid in the construction of *formae* in your mind. It is nearly impossible to learn *formae* without them, although it is possible to cast a well-known spell without them, if necessary. When deprived of your mnemonics, you suffer a penalty to the spellcasting check: -5 if deprived of your voice and -5 if deprived of your ability to gesture.\n\n\nName           | Translation | Description\n---------------|-------------|------------\n[Lux](#)       | Light       | Creates light\n[Impello](#)   | Force       | Move matter with kinetic force\n[Parma](#)     | Shield      | Block the motion of energy and matter\n[Aperio](#)    | Open        | Opens doors, containers, etc\n[Ordo](#)      | Order       | Mend damaged objects, organize sets of things, etc\n[Purgo](#)     | Purge       | Separates impurities from the whole\n[Voce](#)      | Voice       | Creates sound\n[Vide](#)      | See         | Grants sight, physical or metaphysical\n[Ignis](#)     | Fire        | Creates fire or heat\n[Appareo](#)   | Appear      | Teleport yourself\n[Porta](#)     | Portal      | Create portals within or beyond your dimension\n[Velo](#)      | Veil        | Create illusions which hide creatures or objects from sight\n[Formo](#)     | Transform   | Change the shape of an object or creature\n[Glacies](#)    | Ice        | Creates cold or ice, freezes objects or surfaces\n[Tenebrae](#)   | Darkness   | Creates areas of magical darkness, obscures vision\n[Volare](#)     | Fly        | Grants the ability to levitate or fly for a short duration\n[Curare](#)     | Heal       | Restores health or cures minor ailments\n[Animare](#)    | Animate    | Animates objects or creates temporary magical constructs\n[Tempus](#)     | Time       | Alters the flow of time briefly (slow, haste, etc)\n[Mens](#)       | Mind       | Reads thoughts, communicates telepathically, or influences emotions\n[Terra](#)      | Earth      | Manipulates earth, stone, or minerals\n[Aqua](#)       | Water      | Controls or creates water, manipulates liquids\n[Ventus](#)     | Wind       | Generates gusts of wind, manipulates air currents\n[Umbra](#)      | Shadow     | Manipulates shadows, creates shadowy illusions\n\n\n## Lux (Light)\n\nLet there be light!\n\nSkill Use | DC | Description\n----------|----|------------\nFiat Lux  | 10 | Creates an orb of light while you concentrate.

When deprived of your mnemonics, you suffer a penalty to the spellcasting check: -5 if deprived of your voice and -5 if deprived of your ability to gesture.</li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Translation</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#\">Lux</a></td>\n<td>Light</td>\n<td>Creates light</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#\">Impello</a></td>\n<td>Force</td>\n<td>Move matter with kinetic force</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#\">Parma</a></td>\n<td>Shield</td>\n<td>Block the motion of energy and matter</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#\">Aperio</a></td>\n<td>Open</td>\n<td>Opens doors, containers, etc</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#\">Ordo</a></td>\n<td>Order</td>\n<td>Mend damaged objects, organize sets of things, etc</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#\">Purgo</a></td>\n<td>Purge</td>\n<td>Separates impurities from the whole</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#\">Voce</a></td>\n<td>Voice</td>\n<td>Creates sound</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#\">Vide</a></td>\n<td>See</td>\n<td>Grants sight, physical or metaphysical</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#\">Ignis</a></td>\n<td>Fire</td>\n<td>Creates fire or heat</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#\">Appareo</a></td>\n<td>Appear</td>\n<td>Teleport yourself</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#\">Porta</a></td>\n<td>Portal</td>\n<td>Create portals within or beyond your dimension</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#\">Velo</a></td>\n<td>Veil</td>\n<td>Create illusions which hide creatures or objects from sight</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#\">Formo</a></td>\n<td>Transform</td>\n<td>Change the shape of an object or creature</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#\">Glacies</a></td>\n<td>Ice</td>\n<td>Creates cold or ice, freezes objects or surfaces</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#\">Tenebrae</a></td>\n<td>Darkness</td>\n<td>Creates areas of magical darkness, obscures vision</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#\">Volare</a></td>\n<td>Fly</td>\n<td>Grants the ability to levitate or fly for a short duration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#\">Curare</a></td>\n<td>Heal</td>\n<td>Restores health or cures minor ailments</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#\">Animare</a></td>\n<td>Animate</td>\n<td>Animates objects or creates temporary magical constructs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#\">Tempus</a></td>\n<td>Time</td>\n<td>Alters the flow of time briefly (slow, haste, etc)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#\">Mens</a></td>\n<td>Mind</td>\n<td>Reads thoughts, communicates telepathically, or influences emotions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#\">Terra</a></td>\n<td>Earth</td>\n<td>Manipulates earth, stone, or minerals</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#\">Aqua</a></td>\n<td>Water</td>\n<td>Controls or creates water, manipulates liquids</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#\">Ventus</a></td>\n<td>Wind</td>\n<td>Generates gusts of wind, manipulates air currents</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#\">Umbra</a></td>\n<td>Shadow</td>\n<td>Manipulates shadows, creates shadowy illusions</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Lux (Light)</h2>\n<p>Let there be light!</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Skill Use</th>\n<th>DC</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Fiat Lux</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>Creates an orb of light while you concentrate.

Any creature or magical effect that is necrotic or infernal in nature appears as an aura within your vision.

Infernal or undead creatures within the area are compelled to leave; to stay, they must pass a Charisma save, which allows them to remain for one round (at which point they must save again), and they suffer medium radiant damage for remaining in the area. If they fail the save, or forego it, they must spend all available actions to vacate the area, until such time as they are no longer inside it, at which point they may act normally. Any such enemy who attempts to enter the area, including making melee attacks against creatures inside while standing outside, must pass the same save to take such action, and suffer the same penalty for doing so; failing the save causes the action to fail and be lost. If an enemy cannot possibly exit the area, they are not forced to leave; instead, they are offered a Charisma save to negate the radiant damage each round.\n  - At rank 3, all attacks by infernal/undead creatures within the area, as well as attacks made by such creatures outside it against those inside it, suffer disadvantage.\n- [Holy Light](#): each time you strike an infernal or undead foe with a weapon or suffer damage from a foe of the same sort, you gain 1 charge of Holy Light (max 5).

On your next level up, you gain the next ability, etc, until all are gained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Paths\n\n* [Eldritch Knight](#)\n* Ranger\n* Paladin\n* Death Knight\n* Barbarian","bodyHtml":"\n<h1>Fighter</h1>\n<p><img src=\"/img/character/classes/fighter.jpg\" alt=\"Fighter\"></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Attribute</th>\n<th>Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Hit Die</td>\n<td>d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HP/level</td>\n<td>7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weapon Prof.</td>\n<td>2 martial (bonus feat grants all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Armor Prof.</td>\n<td>Light (bonus feat grants all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Saving Throws</td>\n<td>Str, Con</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Talents</th>\n<th>Special Ability</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>13</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>16</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>17</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>18</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>19</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1>Maneuvers</h1>\n<p>1 per level.</p>\n<h2>Assault</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Charge</a>: at-will, std; move up to twice base movement in a straight line, minimum 2 squares; gain advantage to attack or damage roll.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Slam</a>: at-will, std, provokes an attack of opportunity; make a melee attack that inflicts +50% damage.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Rend</a>: recharge 33%, augments a melee attack; attack inflicts half damage on turn start for 3 rounds.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Overpower</a>: recharge 33%, std; normal melee attack, but the enemy is not allowed to use parry or block.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Execute</a>: recharge 33%, std, enemy must be below 50% health; normal attack +100% damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Rank 2</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Great Slam</a>: As <a href=\"#\">Slam</a>, but inflicts +100% extra damage.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Power Charge</a>: As <a href=\"#\">Charge</a>, but inflicts 50% bonus damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protection</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Defensive Stance</a>: when enemies make attacks against allies who are within your melee reach, you can use your own Parry or Block against them.

One soul shard does not equal one human soul--its a far smaller quantity, and in any case, not all souls have the same amount of Anima. The Shard is a useful atomic unit, the smallest significant portion of Anima that can be put to use.\n\nYou can acquire Soul Shards in several ways:\n- Your own soul is worth (5 + Cha) x level soul shards. You can spend from your own soul freely, but if you ever possess less than half of your own total, you are vulnerable to control by extraplanar entities, and at 0, you are helpless to resist them.\n- You can drain soul shards from other creatures with various Invoker powers.\n- Each time you convince an individual with a soul to sin, you gain an amount of shards commensurate with the intensity of the sin (1 for a minor venial sin, 5 for a clear mortal sin, more possible in extreme cases).\n\nYou can spend Soul Shards in several ways:\n- Most powers can be empowered by spending shards, as specified in the power's description.\n- There are some general uses for shards (TBD)\n\n\n## Corruption\nCertain temporary abilities from your powers that cost soul shards can become permanent, not requiring them, although it comes at a cost, twisting your mortal form into one more suited to your increasingly extraplanar nature.\n\nTBD\n\n\n\n# Powers\n\nYou gain one power per level.\n\n\n\n##

Light\nAt-will, swift, concentration; you form light into a crystalline structure of your own design, that you wield with your hand or hands. You can form weapons, shields, handheld tools, etc. They work as well as their mundane counterparts.\n\nFor 1 soul shard, you can make an oversized, supercharged weapon that inflicts heavy damage plus additional benefits based on design:\n- Bludgeoning: each hit causes a push 2 plus knockdown (Str negates).\n- Slashing: you can attack all enemies in a cone 2 with a single melee attack.\n- Piercing: your attacks are a line 5x1.\n\nFor 1 soul shard, you can create a wall up to 10 feet wide and tall per rank.

If you optimize your appearance for a specific purpose, such as seduction or intimidation, this effect grants advantage to skill checks toward that purpose.\n- For 1 soul shard, you can become invisible, remaining so as long as you concentrate, do not move more than half speed, and neither inflict nor suffer damage.\n- For 1 soul shard, you can glamour yourself and allies within a burst 2.\n\n### Magic Fingers\nRanged legerdemain, cause sensations with a touch, etc\n\n\n### Siren Song\nYour voice carries magical power, which can be used to:\n- Countersong\n- Fascinate\n- Suggest\netc...\n\nTBD\n\n### Summon Sprites\nSummon a cloud of sprites:\n- Flame\n- Frost\n- Healing?\n- etc\n\n\n## Infernal\n\n### Curse of Agony\nAt-will, std, ranged; subject is immobilized and unable to take actions (Con ends).\n\nEmpowered:\n- For one soul shard, you can cause a wave of pain to all enemies within a burst 2.\n- For one soul shard, you can rend the subject's body, causing medium ongoing internal damage while the effect persists.\n\n\n### Demon Claw\nAt-will, swift, sustained; your hand or hands transform, growing fearsome claws.

Its form and purpose varies based on your choice of sigil:\n\nFree:\n- Magic Circle: barrier cannot be crossed by the bodies of extraplanar beings, nor by their powers. As a standard action, they can attempt to force their way to the other side by passing a Charisma save against your DC.\n\n1 soul shard:\n- Sigil of Flame: enemies in the area suffer medium fire damage on turn start. Allies gain advantage to damage rolls with fire damage effects.\n- Sigil of Protection: all damage suffered by allies within the area is split evenly between all creatures within the sigil.\n- Sigil of Teleportation: creates two linked sigils. Allies stepping in one are teleported to the other (max once/rd per creature).\n\nIdeas:\n- Anti-magic / Stun\n- Trap (Chains)\n- Blood\n\n### Devil's Eye\nAt-will, swift, concentration; you activate a form of vision where you can see the auras of living or magically-animated creatures (even in total darkness).

But your eyes always glow with visible fel energy, marking your demonic power plainly.\n\n\n### Immolate\nAt-will, std, ranged; subject bursts into flames, suffering medium fire damage, plus the same ongoing (Dex ends).\n\nEmpowered:\n- For one soul shard, you can cause all enemies in a burst 2 to be immolated.\n- For one soul shard, you can cause an ongoing Immolate effect to cause 3 rounds' worth of damage instantly.\n\n\n### Infernal Wings\nAt-will, free or reaction to falling; you sprout infernal wings, allowing you to glide 5 squares horizontally for each 1 square you fall, and negating falling damage. Your jump distance is doubled in height and length.\n\nEmpowered:\n- For one soul shard, you gain a levitate speed equal to your walking speed for 5 rounds. At rank 2, this becomes a fly speed. At rank 3, the speed doubles.\n\nCorruption:\n- You can make Infernal Wings permanent. This costs nothing, but the wings no longer emerge as needed--they are always present.\n\n### Mana Burn\nAt-will, std, ranged; you attempt to dispel any ongoing spell effect by igniting the mana contained within it. If the effect is upon a creature or object, they suffer medium fire damage.

On success, the effect ends.\n- For one soul shard, you can attempt to dispel all spells currently active on a single target, or one spell effect on each target within a burst 2.\n\nRecharge 33%, std, ranged; you attack the magical essence of a creature. If they have generic magical essence, such as Mana or spell slots, you attack those, removing 1d3 of them (1d4+1 at rank 2, 1d6+2 at rank 3, etc), with a Charisma save for half, causing medium fire damage per point removed. You can also target a specific magical ability that does not cost such points (such as an encounter, recharge, or at-will power), causing medium fire damage, and if they fail the save, they lose the ability to use that power for a number of round equal to the die roll previously mentioned.\n- For one soul shard, you can maximize the die roll of mana or rounds.\n\n### Scourge of Seduction\nAt-will, swift, sustained as long as you hold it; you summon a whip, which can be used as a weapon (extended reach, Dex-based, medium slashing damage) which causes pain (on successful damage, subject is immobilized and unable to take actions for 1 round if they fail a Con save). Additional uses:\n- At-will, swift, 3 square reach; subject is grappled by the whip, and unable to move further away unless they defeat you in a Strength contest, disarming you, or if they escape the grapple.\n- At-will, std, 3 square reach, 1 soul shard; subject is stung by the whip (0 damage, but you must still hit), and ensorceled with fel energies. They are compelled to serve you as a faithful minion (Cha ends).\n\n### Wreathed in Flames\nYou gain Resist 50% (fire).\n- For 1 soul shard, as an immediate action, you gain increase this to 100% resistance for 5 rounds.\n\nAt-will, swift, concentration; you immolate yourself, such that enemies who strike you with a natural weapon suffer heavy fire damage each time they do, and enemies within 1 square of you suffer medium fire damage on turn start.\n- If your fire resistance is 100% for any reason, the radiant damage is heavy, not medium, and has a radius of 2 squares.\n\nCorruption:\n- You can make the greater fire resistance permanent, but your skin is permanently demonic (strange color, inhuman texture, markings, etc).\n\n\n## Shadow\n\n### Call of the Void\nInflict fear, madness, or despair upon foes\n\n### Darkness\nCreate darkness.\n\nIdeas:\n- Wall of Shadows\n- Void Zone\n- Armor of Darkness?\n\n### Demi\nRecharge 33%, std, ranged; subject suffers necrotic damage sufficient to reduce their Hit Points to half of maximum (if currently higher). They are allowed a Con save for half damage.\n\nEmpowered:\n- For one soul shard, the damage is sufficient to reduce the target to 1 HP instead.\n- For one soul shard, convert to a circle 2.\n\n### Drain Soul\nAt-will, std, ranged; subject suffers medium necrotic damage, and you gain a soul shard.\n\nIdeas:\n- AoE?\n- Trap the Soul\n\n\n### Shadow Form\nAt-will, swift, sustained; you obscure your features, becoming a silhouette of darkness.

Each round, as a standard action, you can command it to attack a single target within range, causing heavy disintegration damage if it hits. When you wish to end the spell, you must spend a standard action and defeat the spell's DC with a Charisma save. On failure, it does not go away, and if you fail by 10 or more, it attacks whoever it pleases. Each time the star strikes for damage, its DC increases by 1.\n\nEnhancement ideas:\n- Use it defensively\n- AoE's (line attacks)\n","bodyHtml":"<h1>Invoker</h1>\n<p><img src=\"/system8/img/character/classes/invoker.jpg\" alt=\"Invoker\"></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Attribute</th>\n<th>Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Hit Die</td>\n<td>d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HP/level</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weapon Prof.</td>\n<td>Simple Weapons, Rod</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Armor Prof.</td>\n<td>None</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Saving Throws</td>\n<td>Int, Cha</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bonus Skills</td>\n<td>Invocation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Special Ability</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1>Abilities</h1>\n<h2>Soul Shards</h2>\n<p>Soul Shards are a unit of measuring Anima, or the essence contained within souls.

On failure, it does not go away, and if you fail by 10 or more, it attacks whoever it pleases.

On success, the enemy uses their reaction to avoid the fictitious attack. (Against a PC, roll both rolls secretly, and tell the PC if they are hit; they can still decide if they want to use their reaction).\n- [Fan of Knives](#): recharge 33%, std, cone 3; light piercing damage to all targets (can apply poison).\n- [Pocket Sand](#): recharge 33%, swift, melee range; subject is blinded (Con ends).\n- [Sap](#): alternate option for Sneak Attack, causes unconsciousness (Con negates), which ends if subject suffers any damage or is vigourously awakened by another creature's Help action.\n- [Smokescreen](#): recharge 33%, swift, close burst 1; area is obscured by smoke, granting concealment to all within. Useful for Stealth.\n- [Kick](#): reaction to enemy casting a spell, melee range; roll an attack. Caster must pass a Con save against your attack (if it hits), or else lose the spell.\n\n\n## Assassin\n- [Death Attack](#): at-will, std; you prepare a death attack against the subject, granting +100% damage to your next Sneak Attack against them. This can stack up to +300%. All bonus damage must be used within the encounter, or it is lost.\n- [Phantom Foe](#): recharge 33%, swift, concentration; subject is haunted by a phantasmal attacker. They cannot see them (nobody can, it's an illusion), but they remain alert to the foe's attacks. As such, you and allies gain the Flanking bonus against subject, even if only one is threatening the subject.\n- [Pain Absorption](#): at-will, 1 soul shard, reaction to suffering damage; exercising an ancient technique passed from assassin to assassin, you harness the pain of a strike, and convert it into deadly power. Half of the damage of the attack is negated. Furthermore, record the amount that was negated; you can add that amount to a weapon attack within the next 3 rounds.\n- Oath of Murder\n- [Void Strike](#): 1 soul shard, swift; you whisper words of Shadow magic, imbuing your melee weapon with the power of the Void. Your next successful melee attack also dispels one magical effect on the subject, if the attack roll exceeds that effect's DC.\n\n\n## Shadowdancer\n- [Shadowstep](#): Recharge 33%, move, you must be in dimness or darkness; you teleport to a square within range that you can see, that is itself in dimness or darkness.\n- [Shadow Pin](#): Recharge 33%, swift, ranged; you pin subject's shadow in place, thereby preventing subject from moving from their current position. They can attempt to free themselves with a Strength save once/rd, but on success, they must also suffer medium slashing damage to escape. Only works if subject casts a shadow.\n- [Shadow Play](#): Recharge 33%, swift, concentration; while in dimness or darkness, you can create shadowy silhouttes of creatures and objects within a circle 2. They are insubstantial, but they may fool onlookers, who assume they are real unless they physical interact with them, in which case they are allowed a Wisdom save to disbelieve the illusion. PCs are allowed to declare that they disbelieve at any time, but they must still succeed at the saving throw.\n- [Shadow Form](#): Recharge 33%, reaction, you must be in dimness or darkness; you become an incorporeal shadow. On your next turn, at some point, you must return to corporealness.\n\n\n## Bard\n- [Inspiring Melody](#): Encounter, swift, close burst 10; allies hear your song and are inspired to greatness. Each ally gains one token, which can be applied as they please to any single d20 roll during the encounter. Applying the token improves the roll by 1d6 (increasing to 1d8 at rank 2, 1d10 at rank 3, etc). This not only increases the result, but can also create critical success (for example, rolling a 16 naturally, then rolling 4 or higher on the inspiration, would count as a natural 20).\n- [Fascinating Song](#): Encounter, std, emanation 10, concentration; subjects who are not in combat are fascinated, fully paying attention to your song. You must spend a standard action each round performing in order to maintain this effect (in addition to normal concentration rules). Those subjects who have reason to attempt not to pay attention to you, such as perceiving hostile action, suspecting your motives, or, if a PC, no reason necessary, are allowed a Wisdom save against your Perform check once per round to end the effect. In general, NPCs must have a valid reason to attempt this. Any obvious hostile action, such as an attack on subject or an ally that they are able to perceive while paying attention to you, automatically ends the effect.\n- [Countersong](#): Recharge 33%, reaction to any hostile effect that relies on sound; you attempt to counter the effect. Roll Perform; if your results meets or exceeds the hostile effect, you negate it. If the effect is ongoing, you must continually perform to continue to negate it, which requires Concentration; as soon as your Countersong ends, it stops negating the effect (if it was still going).\n\n\n\n## Spellthief\n- [Scan](#): At-will, swift, ranged; you analyze a subject's magical signature, learning if it possess magical abilities. Roll an Investigation check; you learn which spells subject has available to cast based on their rank (DC 10 + 5 per rank).\n- [Steal Spell](#): At-will, std, melee range, requires advantage; you attempt to steal a spell or magical power from the subject. Subject must either be a creature with the ability to cast spells, or a magic item that produces spell-like effects. Roll a Sleight of Hand check; the subject may resist with Perception check.\n  - On success, you steal a random spell that the subject possesses. (see below)\n  - On failure, nothing happens. \n  - When you steal a spell, the gain a single, consumable use of that spell, exactly as described. You may use it any time before the next long rest; if not used by then, it fades away. The subject \"loses\" the spell, which varies in meaning:\n    - If they have spell slots or Mana, they lose an amount equal to what they would spend casting that spell normally.\n    - If the ability has a cooldown, it goes on cooldown as if it was used by the subject.\n  - Normally, the spell you steal is determined randomly (equal chance for each known spell). However, if you have knowledge of what spells the subject has, you can target a specific spell with your attempt.\n  - If your spell theft decreased spell slots or Mana in the subject, you have the option of gaining said slots or Mana yourself instead of casting the spell.\n\n\n\n## TBD\n\n\n\n\n# Talents\n1 per level\n\n\n## Assassin\n- [Poisoner](#): You can craft and apply poisons to your weapons. You also gain Resist 50% (poison).\n  - Deadly Poison: basic poison that causes medium ongoing poison damage (Con ends).\n  - Numbing Poison: deadens the reflexes, causing disadvantage to reaction-based defenses (parry, dodge, etc), Con ends.\n  - Magekiller Poison: subject must pass a Con save against the poison's DC when casting a spell, or else lose it. Con ends.\n  - Slowing Poison: -50% movement speed, Con ends.\n  - Wound Poison: subject cannot heal, Con ends.\n  - Hallucinogenic Poison: subject is confused, acting randomly (25% do nothing, 25% attack nearest target, 25% move randomly, 25% act normally). Con ends.\n- [Soul Blade](#): You prepare your melee weapon to enable it to steal soul energy from targets. On successful Sneak Attacks, you gain 1 soul shard. Various Assassin abilities use soul shards (as well as the [Invoker](./invoker.md) class).\n- [Soul Gem](#): You can prepare a soul gem (at a cost of TBD gold per HD of capacity). If you slay a creature, you can trap their soul in the gem, preventing any form of resurrection, and allowing uses of their trapped soul, such as:\n  - Soul Sacrifice: upon suffering death, you can sacrifice the trapped soul, expending it, and negating the death effect.\n  - Death Eater: as a swift action, you can absorb a trapped soul, healing yourself equal to the soul's original max HP, expending it.\n  - Shadow Identity: at-will, swift, concentration; you take on the appearance of the soul's owner, as they appeared in life.\n- [Lifesense](#): While you possess at least one soul shard, you gain the ability to see the flowing blood and warmth of living creatures, even in total darkness. This also grants a +1 bonus to critical range.\n\n\n## Cool Rogue\n- [Cunning Action](#): You may use the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action as a swift action instead of standard.\n- [Evasion](#): You can use the Dodge reaction against area effects. Instead of the attack's DC (if it had one), you must roll against DC 10 + 5 per square, where the number of squares is the number you must move to escape the effect (maximum: your normal movement rate). If you succeed, you leap to the nearest safe square and avoid the effect. Otherwise, you do not move, and suffer the effect normally.\n- [Preparation](#): When you begin combat, if you are not surprised, you may automatically enter Stealth, and move up to half your movement speed before anyone else takes a turn.\n- [Uncanny Dodge](#): You may use the Dodge action without spending a reaction, a number of times per encounter equal to your Dex bonus. Also, you may Dodge attacks of which you were unaware.\n- [Lightfoot](#): Gain +3 base movement, and Resist 50% (falling damage).\n- Tactical Insertion\n- Trap Sense\n\n\n## Shadowdancer\n- [Cloak of Shadows](#): While in dimness or darkness, you gain +2 per rank to AC and saving throws.\n- [Shadowsight](#): You suffer no movement penalty in darkness, nor does dimness count as concealment in your sight. You can pinpoint the location of enemies in total darkness, identifying their occupied squares (although your attacks still suffer disadvantage).\n\n## Spellthief\n- [Spell Lock](#): You can use Steal Spell as a reaction. If you successfully steal a spell in this manner, it not only interrupts the spell, but locks the caster out of that spell's school until they pass an Int save.\n- [Spell Mastery](#): Each time you steal a spell, you have a chance to master it by passing the appropriate spellcasting skill check (e.g. [Arcana](#) for Arcanist spells, [Thaumaturgy](#) for Thaumaturgist spells, etc), with a DC of 10 + 5 per rank. Failure has no ill effect. On success, if the spell is appropriate for your rank, you add it to your known repertoire.\n  - This ability does not grant Mana or other resources. Spells that require such still require it, so you'd have to provide Mana somehow.\n\n## Also...\n- Shadowdancer\n- Assassin\n- Bard\n- Spellthief\n- Roguelock?","bodyHtml":"\n<h1>Rogue</h1>\n<p><img src=\"/img/character/classes/rogue.jpg\" alt=\"Rogue\"></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Attribute</th>\n<th>Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Hit Die</td>\n<td>d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HP/level</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weapon Prof.</td>\n<td>Dex-based martial weapons</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Armor Prof.</td>\n<td>Light</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Saving Throws</td>\n<td>Dex, Int</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Special Ability</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Sneak Attack, Maneuvers, Talents</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1>Sneak Attack</h1>\n<p>When you attack with a Dex-based weapon, and your attack has advantage, you inflict bonus damage equal to the weapon's critical bonus damage.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A rank 1 rogue has Dex +2, and is attacking with a light-damage weapon with a critical power of 100%.\n<ul>\n<li>On a normal hit, they inflict 1d4+1 damage.</li>\n<li>On a sneak attack or critical hit, they inflict 1d4+1 + 100% damage (or 1d4+1 times 2)</li>\n<li>On a critical sneak attack, they inflict 1d4+1 + 200%, or 1d4+1 times 3</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A rank 2 rogue with Dex +3 attacks with a medium-damage weapon with a critical power of 100%\n<ul>\n<li>On a normal hit, they inflict 2d8+3 damage.</li>\n<li>On a sneak attack or critical hit, they inflict 2d8+3 + 100% damage, or 2d8+3 times 2.</li>\n<li>On a critical sneak attack, they inflict 2d8+3 + 200% damage, or 2d8+3 times 3.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A rank 3 rogue with Dex +4 attacks with a medim-damage weapon with a critical power of 150%.\n<ul>\n<li>On a normal hit, they inflict 3d8+4 damage.</li>\n<li>On a critical or sneak attack hit, they inflict 3d8+4 + 150%, or 3d8+4 times 2.5</li>\n<li>On a critical sneak attack hit, they inflict 3d8+4 + 300%, or 3d8+4 times 4</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Maneuvers</h1>\n<p>1 per level.</p>\n<h2>Regular Rogue Stuff</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Feint</a>: at-will, swift, melee range; roll Deception vs Perception. On success, the enemy uses their reaction to avoid the fictitious attack. (Against a PC, roll both rolls secretly, and tell the PC if they are hit; they can still decide if they want to use their reaction).</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Fan of Knives</a>: recharge 33%, std, cone 3; light piercing damage to all targets (can apply poison).</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Pocket Sand</a>: recharge 33%, swift, melee range; subject is blinded (Con ends).</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Sap</a>: alternate option for Sneak Attack, causes unconsciousness (Con negates), which ends if subject suffers any damage or is vigourously awakened by another creature's Help action.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Smokescreen</a>: recharge 33%, swift, close burst 1; area is obscured by smoke, granting concealment to all within. Useful for Stealth.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Kick</a>: reaction to enemy casting a spell, melee range; roll an attack. Caster must pass a Con save against your attack (if it hits), or else lose the spell.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Assassin</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Death Attack</a>: at-will, std; you prepare a death attack against the subject, granting +100% damage to your next Sneak Attack against them. This can stack up to +300%. All bonus damage must be used within the encounter, or it is lost.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Phantom Foe</a>: recharge 33%, swift, concentration; subject is haunted by a phantasmal attacker. They cannot see them (nobody can, it's an illusion), but they remain alert to the foe's attacks. As such, you and allies gain the Flanking bonus against subject, even if only one is threatening the subject.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Pain Absorption</a>: at-will, 1 soul shard, reaction to suffering damage; exercising an ancient technique passed from assassin to assassin, you harness the pain of a strike, and convert it into deadly power. Half of the damage of the attack is negated. Furthermore, record the amount that was negated; you can add that amount to a weapon attack within the next 3 rounds.</li>\n<li>Oath of Murder</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Void Strike</a>: 1 soul shard, swift; you whisper words of Shadow magic, imbuing your melee weapon with the power of the Void. Your next successful melee attack also dispels one magical effect on the subject, if the attack roll exceeds that effect's DC.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Shadowdancer</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Shadowstep</a>: Recharge 33%, move, you must be in dimness or darkness; you teleport to a square within range that you can see, that is itself in dimness or darkness.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Shadow Pin</a>: Recharge 33%, swift, ranged; you pin subject's shadow in place, thereby preventing subject from moving from their current position. They can attempt to free themselves with a Strength save once/rd, but on success, they must also suffer medium slashing damage to escape. Only works if subject casts a shadow.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Shadow Play</a>: Recharge 33%, swift, concentration; while in dimness or darkness, you can create shadowy silhouttes of creatures and objects within a circle 2. They are insubstantial, but they may fool onlookers, who assume they are real unless they physical interact with them, in which case they are allowed a Wisdom save to disbelieve the illusion. PCs are allowed to declare that they disbelieve at any time, but they must still succeed at the saving throw.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Shadow Form</a>: Recharge 33%, reaction, you must be in dimness or darkness; you become an incorporeal shadow. On your next turn, at some point, you must return to corporealness.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bard</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Inspiring Melody</a>: Encounter, swift, close burst 10; allies hear your song and are inspired to greatness. Each ally gains one token, which can be applied as they please to any single d20 roll during the encounter. Applying the token improves the roll by 1d6 (increasing to 1d8 at rank 2, 1d10 at rank 3, etc). This not only increases the result, but can also create critical success (for example, rolling a 16 naturally, then rolling 4 or higher on the inspiration, would count as a natural 20).</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Fascinating Song</a>: Encounter, std, emanation 10, concentration; subjects who are not in combat are fascinated, fully paying attention to your song. You must spend a standard action each round performing in order to maintain this effect (in addition to normal concentration rules). Those subjects who have reason to attempt not to pay attention to you, such as perceiving hostile action, suspecting your motives, or, if a PC, no reason necessary, are allowed a Wisdom save against your Perform check once per round to end the effect. In general, NPCs must have a valid reason to attempt this. Any obvious hostile action, such as an attack on subject or an ally that they are able to perceive while paying attention to you, automatically ends the effect.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Countersong</a>: Recharge 33%, reaction to any hostile effect that relies on sound; you attempt to counter the effect. Roll Perform; if your results meets or exceeds the hostile effect, you negate it. If the effect is ongoing, you must continually perform to continue to negate it, which requires Concentration; as soon as your Countersong ends, it stops negating the effect (if it was still going).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Spellthief</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Scan</a>: At-will, swift, ranged; you analyze a subject's magical signature, learning if it possess magical abilities. Roll an Investigation check; you learn which spells subject has available to cast based on their rank (DC 10 + 5 per rank).</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Steal Spell</a>: At-will, std, melee range, requires advantage; you attempt to steal a spell or magical power from the subject. Subject must either be a creature with the ability to cast spells, or a magic item that produces spell-like effects. Roll a Sleight of Hand check; the subject may resist with Perception check.\n<ul>\n<li>On success, you steal a random spell that the subject possesses. (see below)</li>\n<li>On failure, nothing happens.</li>\n<li>When you steal a spell, the gain a single, consumable use of that spell, exactly as described. You may use it any time before the next long rest; if not used by then, it fades away. The subject &quot;loses&quot; the spell, which varies in meaning:\n<ul>\n<li>If they have spell slots or Mana, they lose an amount equal to what they would spend casting that spell normally.</li>\n<li>If the ability has a cooldown, it goes on cooldown as if it was used by the subject.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Normally, the spell you steal is determined randomly (equal chance for each known spell). However, if you have knowledge of what spells the subject has, you can target a specific spell with your attempt.</li>\n<li>If your spell theft decreased spell slots or Mana in the subject, you have the option of gaining said slots or Mana yourself instead of casting the spell.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>TBD</h2>\n<h1>Talents</h1>\n<p>1 per level</p>\n<h2>Assassin</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Poisoner</a>: You can craft and apply poisons to your weapons. You also gain Resist 50% (poison).\n<ul>\n<li>Deadly Poison: basic poison that causes medium ongoing poison damage (Con ends).</li>\n<li>Numbing Poison: deadens the reflexes, causing disadvantage to reaction-based defenses (parry, dodge, etc), Con ends.</li>\n<li>Magekiller Poison: subject must pass a Con save against the poison's DC when casting a spell, or else lose it. Con ends.</li>\n<li>Slowing Poison: -50% movement speed, Con ends.</li>\n<li>Wound Poison: subject cannot heal, Con ends.</li>\n<li>Hallucinogenic Poison: subject is confused, acting randomly (25% do nothing, 25% attack nearest target, 25% move randomly, 25% act normally). Con ends.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Soul Blade</a>: You prepare your melee weapon to enable it to steal soul energy from targets. On successful Sneak Attacks, you gain 1 soul shard. Various Assassin abilities use soul shards (as well as the <a href=\"./invoker.md\">Invoker</a> class).</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Soul Gem</a>: You can prepare a soul gem (at a cost of TBD gold per HD of capacity). If you slay a creature, you can trap their soul in the gem, preventing any form of resurrection, and allowing uses of their trapped soul, such as:\n<ul>\n<li>Soul Sacrifice: upon suffering death, you can sacrifice the trapped soul, expending it, and negating the death effect.</li>\n<li>Death Eater: as a swift action, you can absorb a trapped soul, healing yourself equal to the soul's original max HP, expending it.</li>\n<li>Shadow Identity: at-will, swift, concentration; you take on the appearance of the soul's owner, as they appeared in life.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Lifesense</a>: While you possess at least one soul shard, you gain the ability to see the flowing blood and warmth of living creatures, even in total darkness. This also grants a +1 bonus to critical range.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Cool Rogue</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Cunning Action</a>: You may use the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action as a swift action instead of standard.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Evasion</a>: You can use the Dodge reaction against area effects. Instead of the attack's DC (if it had one), you must roll against DC 10 + 5 per square, where the number of squares is the number you must move to escape the effect (maximum: your normal movement rate). If you succeed, you leap to the nearest safe square and avoid the effect. Otherwise, you do not move, and suffer the effect normally.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Preparation</a>: When you begin combat, if you are not surprised, you may automatically enter Stealth, and move up to half your movement speed before anyone else takes a turn.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Uncanny Dodge</a>: You may use the Dodge action without spending a reaction, a number of times per encounter equal to your Dex bonus. Also, you may Dodge attacks of which you were unaware.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Lightfoot</a>: Gain +3 base movement, and Resist 50% (falling damage).</li>\n<li>Tactical Insertion</li>\n<li>Trap Sense</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Shadowdancer</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Cloak of Shadows</a>: While in dimness or darkness, you gain +2 per rank to AC and saving throws.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Shadowsight</a>: You suffer no movement penalty in darkness, nor does dimness count as concealment in your sight. You can pinpoint the location of enemies in total darkness, identifying their occupied squares (although your attacks still suffer disadvantage).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Spellthief</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Spell Lock</a>: You can use Steal Spell as a reaction. If you successfully steal a spell in this manner, it not only interrupts the spell, but locks the caster out of that spell's school until they pass an Int save.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Spell Mastery</a>: Each time you steal a spell, you have a chance to master it by passing the appropriate spellcasting skill check (e.g. <a href=\"#\">Arcana</a> for Arcanist spells, <a href=\"#\">Thaumaturgy</a> for Thaumaturgist spells, etc), with a DC of 10 + 5 per rank.

It is not that literal blood has energy, but rather blood is sympathetically linked to the life energy of the being to which it belongs.

The blood of others becomes symbolically yours by the act of either being offered it (in the case of an ally), or taking it unwilling, such as when attacking a creature.\n\nBlood Vitae has the effect of intensifying your most primeval instincts. A modest amount will energize you, readying you to fight or flee, alerting your senses, etc. A large amount will agonize your hunger, intensify your fear, and send your heart racing as life becomes too much.\n\n\n\n\n# Spells\n\nBesides the below schools, you may learn spells from the Air, Frost, and Plants schools of the [Elementalist](./elementalist).\n\n\n## Blood\nRank | Power          | Description\n-----|----------------|------------\n0    | [Blood Boil](../powers/thaumaturgist/blood-boil)     |\n1    | [Transfusion](../powers/thaumaturgist/transfusion)    |\n2    | [Blood Bond](../powers/thaumaturgist/blood-bond)     | Share your strength with allies, or steal strength from enemies\n2    | [Blood Bending](../powers/thaumaturgist/blood-bending) | Control a creature's movements\n3    | [Frozen Blood](../powers/thaumaturgist/frozen-blood)   | Your blood doesn't flow; damage doesn't affect you while active (but still must be healed)\n3    | [Exsanguinate](../powers/thaumaturgist/exsanguinate)   | Drain all the blood from a creature\n\nIdeas:\n- Let Blood: take damage, add it to your spells\n- Bloodborne: infect subject with a bloodborne pathogen:\n  - Hemophilia (slashing/piercing causes ongoing damage)\n  - Sickle-cell (debilitating pain)\n  - Anemia (causes exhaustion)\n  - Should Blood Boil be rolled into this?\n- Burning Blood: dripped blood becomes a burning square\n- Ring of Fire\n- Blood Nova (target can be friendly or enemy, but only harms others)\n\n## Illusion\n\nRank | Power         | Description\n-----|---------------|------------\n0    | Phantom Sound |\n1    | Figment       | Create an illusory creature or object\n1    | Glamour       | Change your appearance\n1    | Mystic Eyes   | See through others' illusions\n2    | Veil          | Invisibility\n2    | Mirror Image  |\n2    | Hallucination | Total illusory control of an area--create walls, multiple creatures/objects, etc\n3    | Simulacrum    | Create an image of a creature that is real enough to affect the world, cast spells, etc\n3    | Phantom Zone  | Send a creature into an illusory domain you control (similar to 3e Maze spell)\n\n\n## Hex\n\nRank | Power          | Description\n-----|----------------|------------\n0    | [Hex](../powers/thaumaturgist/hex)            | Subject has disadvantage to the next attack, skill check, or save they make; you can specify the ability score to hex.\n1    | [Curse](../powers/thaumaturgist/curse)          | Curse an enemy with weakness, clumsiness, or frailty\n2    | [Malediction](../powers/thaumaturgist/malediction)    | Curse an enemy with vulnerability, lethargy, or distraction\n3    | [Doom](../powers/thaumaturgist/doom)           | Curse an enemy to wither away, harm themselves, or fail at all endeavors\n\n\n## Antimagic\n\nRank | Power          | Description\n-----|----------------|------------\n1    | [Absorb Magic](../powers/thaumaturgist/absorb-magic)   | Absorb energy from a touched spell, weakening or dispelling it\n2    | [Negation](../powers/thaumaturgist/negation)       | Disable a single spell or magic item so it can't be used\n2    | [Commandeer Spell](../powers/thaumaturgist/commandeer-spell) | Take control of a spell, changing it as you please\n3    | Antimagic Zone | Area nullifies magic\n\nTodo: merge negation and commadeer spell into Spellsteal\n\n\n## Soul\n\nRank | Power          | Description\n-----|----------------|------------\n0    | [Soulgaze](../powers/thaumaturgist/soulgaze)       | Lock eyes with target and learn their secrets--but they learn yours, too\n1    | [Drain Soul](../powers/thaumaturgist/drain-soul)     | Enervate enemy and gain a soul gem, which can grant you access to their identity and abilities\n2    | Magic Jar      | You detach your soul from your body, which becomes helpless.

Simple weapons inflict one of three damage types (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing), and their basic mechanics are given by their weight using the table below.\n\n| Weapon Type | Damage | Ability Score | Handedness          |\n|-------------|--------|---------------|---------------------|\n| Light       | 1d4    | Dex           | One-hand or offhand |\n| Medium      | 1d8    | Dex or Str    | One-hand            |\n| Heavy       | 1d12   | Str           | Two-hand            |\n\n\n# Simple Ranged Weapons\nAll characters have proficiency with simple ranged weapons.\n\n| Weapon Type | Damage | Ability Score | Handedness          | Range   |\n|-------------|--------|---------------|---------------------|---------|\n| Light       | 1d4    | Dex           | One-hand or offhand | 30/120  |\n| Medium      | 1d6    | Dex or Str    | Two-hand            | 60/240  |\n| Heavy       | 1d8    | Str           | Two-hand            | 100/400 |\n\n# Martial weapons\nMartial weapons are made for war, designed for use by trained fighters. Only some classes have proficiency with these weapons.\n\nAny given martial weapon uses the mechanics of a Simple Weapon (see above), with one additional modifier from the list below. The additional properties of the modifier require Proficiency. Some abilities require Expertise or even Mastery.\n\n\n\n## Cleaving\n- Proficient: On a successful hit, you can immediately roll another attack on an adjacent enemy within reach.\n- Expertise: You can keep chaining cleaves until you run out of adjacent enemies within reach.\n- Mastery: Instead of rolling normally, you can, as a standard action, make a single attack which affects all enemies within reach.\n\n## Reach\n- Proficiency: Gain +1 reach with all attacks with the weapon, and also threaten the extra area.\n- Expertise: When your attack of opportunity with the weapon succeeds, you arrest any movement the enemy was making.\n- Mastery: Instead of a normal attack, you can attack any number of creatures in a line extending from you to the extent of reach.\n\n## Defensive\n- Proficient: The weapon can be used to Block (its normal damage). Parry attempts with the weapon gain a bonus equal to your proficiency bonus.\n- Expertise: Once per round per proficiency bonus, parry or block attempts with the weapon do not require spending a reaction.\n- Mastery: When Block attempts fail, you still block half the normal damage.\n\n## Piercing\n- Proficiency: When successfully striking an enemy with a non-zero armor bonus, you reduce their armor bonus by your proficiency bonus for 1 round (non-stacking).\n- Expertise: Armor piercing penalty lasts 3 rds.\n- Mastery: Your attacks ignore your proficiency bonus' worth of armor bonus.\n\n## Crushing\n- Proficiency: On successful strike, you cause staggered. Staggered opponents have disadvantage on their next parry, dodge, or block attempt, or 50% reduction to their next move action, whichever comes first.\n- Expertise: On successful strike, instead of staggering, you can cause a knockdown (Str negates) or push back 1 square (no save, must be your size or smaller).\n- Mastery: On critical hits, or any hit where none of your damage was absorbed or resisted, the enemy is stunned for 1 rd (Con negates).\n\n## Prehensile (i.e. whip)\n- Proficiency: The weapon can be used to trip or disarm, and neither invites a counter-trip or counter-disarm.\n- Expertise: The weapon can be used to grapple.\n- Mastery: ?\n\n## Stealthy\n- Proficiency: When striking with advantage, gain proficiency bonus as bonus critical range.\n- Expertise: When striking with advantage, always add critical bonus damage; on crit, add it again.\n- Mastery: When striking with advantage, all critical bonus damage is also ongoing (Con ends).\n\n\n\n## Ranged Only\n\n## Fully Automatic\n  - Proficiency: On successful hit, can attempt another attack on the same target at -10. Stackable.\n  - Expertise: Instead of targeting one creature, you can shoot everyone in a cone, inflicting normal damage with a Dex save to negate.\n  - Mastery: Area attack is save half; autofire is -5 penalty.\n## Repeater (semi-automatic)\n  - Proficiency: you can fire three times (if ammunition allows), gaining advantage to the attack roll.\n  - Expertise: You can fire three times, targeting three different enemies in a cone.\n  - Mastery: on hit, you can fire again at the same target. If that hits, you can try it again (max 3 shots).\n\n\n\n# Exotic Weapons\nExotic weapons have more than one Martial property. Warrior classes do not get proficiency in exotic weapons for free as they do with Martial weapons, but you can still learn proficiency with a feat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Weapon Enhancements\n\nThrough magic, special materials, class abilities, or other means, it is possible to enhance a weapon beyond its physical properties.\n\n## Keen\nA keen weapon strikes true, seeking the most vulnerable location to inflict maximum damage.\n\n- All ranks: gain +1 per rank to critical range and +50% to critical damage multiplier.\n- Rank 1: each non-critical hit adds 5 points of critical vulnerability to the target, meaning all attacks against them have 5 points of effective critical range. This lasts until the next critical hit lands on the target.\n- Rank 2: after a successful critical hit on any subject, gain +5 critical threat range to your next attack with the weapon.\n- Rank 3: critical vulnerability added to target is now 10 points instead of 5.\n- Rank 4: when you score a critical hit, roll again (without any crit vulnerability bonuses). If that attack is also a critical hit, apply the critical damage multiplier again. (Ex: base damage 10, crit mult 3, crit damage is normally 30, but in this case, 90).\n- Rank 5: tbd\n\n## Flaming\nA flaming weapon engulfs in flame when drawn, burning enemies with every strike.\n\n- All ranks: add \"fire\" to damage type in addition to normal type. Each attack inflicts 50% of its damage as ongoing damage (Dex ends).\n- Rank 1: at-will, std, cone 3; sweeping the weapon in a wide arc, you generate a fan of flame, inflicting half the weapon's damage (plus same as ongoing fire damage, Dex ends) as fire damage to all subjects within.\n- Rank 2: when you inflict damage with this weapon against a target already suffering ongoing fire damage, it causes a burst of fire, inflicting half base damage as fire damage to all enemies in a burst 2.\n- Rank 3: tbd\n\n## Radiant\nThis weapon is made of brilliant energy, not mere metal, wood, etc. It can penetrate many normal defenses.\n\n- All ranks: ignore 4 points of armor bonus per rank. Damage type switches to radiant. Weapon sheds light like a torch.\n- Rank 1: tbd\n\n## Powerful\nA powerful weapon focuses on damage above all, magnifying the momentum of every strike delivered.\n\n- All ranks: gain +1 damage per rank, per damage die. (Example: rank 2 enhanced weapon that deals 3d12 would gain +6 bonus damage from this enhancement)\n- Rank 1: when you inflict damage with this weapon, you cause a burst 1, inflicting this enhancement's bonus damage as force damage to enemies in the area. Area increases to burst 2 at rank 3, and to burst 3 at rank 5.\n- Rank 2: when inflicting damage with this weapon, roll damage twice, and use the higher result.\n- Rank 3: each time you inflict damage with this weapon, gain +1 damage die with all further attacks this encounter, max 1 die per rank.\n- Rank 4/5: tbd\n\n## Warding\nA warding weapon is a stalwart defender, always ready to shield you from all harm.\n\n- All ranks: gain +1 to AC and +2 to Parry per rank.\n- Rank 1: the weapon can be used to parry missiles and targeted spells.\n- Rank 2: the weapon can be used by your allies to parry, using your Parry roll, but the ally's reaction. Ally must be within 3 squares.\n- Rank 3: tbd\n","bodyHtml":"<h1>Weapons</h1>\n<p>Normal (non-magical) weapons are described herein.</p>\n<h1>Simple Melee Weapons</h1>\n<p>All characters have proficiency with simple weapons.

This lasts until the next critical hit lands on the target.</li>\n<li>Rank 2: after a successful critical hit on any subject, gain +5 critical threat range to your next attack with the weapon.</li>\n<li>Rank 3: critical vulnerability added to target is now 10 points instead of 5.</li>\n<li>Rank 4: when you score a critical hit, roll again (without any crit vulnerability bonuses). If that attack is also a critical hit, apply the critical damage multiplier again. (Ex: base damage 10, crit mult 3, crit damage is normally 30, but in this case, 90).</li>\n<li>Rank 5: tbd</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Flaming</h2>\n<p>A flaming weapon engulfs in flame when drawn, burning enemies with every strike.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All ranks: add &quot;fire&quot; to damage type in addition to normal type. Each attack inflicts 50% of its damage as ongoing damage (Dex ends).</li>\n<li>Rank 1: at-will, std, cone 3; sweeping the weapon in a wide arc, you generate a fan of flame, inflicting half the weapon's damage (plus same as ongoing fire damage, Dex ends) as fire damage to all subjects within.</li>\n<li>Rank 2: when you inflict damage with this weapon against a target already suffering ongoing fire damage, it causes a burst of fire, inflicting half base damage as fire damage to all enemies in a burst 2.</li>\n<li>Rank 3: tbd</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Radiant</h2>\n<p>This weapon is made of brilliant energy, not mere metal, wood, etc. It can penetrate many normal defenses.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All ranks: ignore 4 points of armor bonus per rank. Damage type switches to radiant. Weapon sheds light like a torch.</li>\n<li>Rank 1: tbd</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Powerful</h2>\n<p>A powerful weapon focuses on damage above all, magnifying the momentum of every strike delivered.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All ranks: gain +1 damage per rank, per damage die. (Example: rank 2 enhanced weapon that deals 3d12 would gain +6 bonus damage from this enhancement)</li>\n<li>Rank 1: when you inflict damage with this weapon, you cause a burst 1, inflicting this enhancement's bonus damage as force damage to enemies in the area. Area increases to burst 2 at rank 3, and to burst 3 at rank 5.</li>\n<li>Rank 2: when inflicting damage with this weapon, roll damage twice, and use the higher result.</li>\n<li>Rank 3: each time you inflict damage with this weapon, gain +1 damage die with all further attacks this encounter, max 1 die per rank.</li>\n<li>Rank 4/5: tbd</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Warding</h2>\n<p>A warding weapon is a stalwart defender, always ready to shield you from all harm.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All ranks: gain +1 to AC and +2 to Parry per rank.</li>\n<li>Rank 1: the weapon can be used to parry missiles and targeted spells.</li>\n<li>Rank 2: the weapon can be used by your allies to parry, using your Parry roll, but the ally's reaction. Ally must be within 3 squares.</li>\n<li>Rank 3: tbd</li>\n</ul>\n","metadata":null,"transformedMetadata":"default transform"},{"name":"alchemy","contents":"\n# Potions\n\n## Debilitation\n| Rank | Name         | Description                                                                                 |\n| ---- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1    | Thunderstone | Stone explodes when thrown or subject to heat, causing intense sound that deafens and stuns |\n| 1    | Web          | Glob of sticky goo expands when thrown, encasing foes and sticking them in place            |\n\n## Defense\n\n| Rank | Name                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| ---- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1    | Potion of Warmth/Coolness | Potion provides protection from cold/hot extremes, resist cold/fire damage by X%                                                                                                             |\n| 1    | Shield Bangle             | Enchant one or more breakable things (twigs, glass baubles, etc) that you wear; each is a consumable ward that absorbs some of the damage you suffer                                         |\n| 2    | Wood Ward                 | Using a fetish of wood, you repel wooden weapons.

The bottle's magic is finite, so the radius decreases by 1 square every 2 rounds (3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0). If allowed to drain fully, it releases the stored air into the environment, which shatters the bottle and causes a loud clap that might pop your ears. If stoppered before fully draining, the bottle contains the air that was sucked in, and the vacuum maintenance fades quickly, causing a burst of wind that is painful, but probably not as painful as the vacuum was.

You can have conversations with it; it shares your perceptions, but does not control your actions; it has alien knowledge that may be of use to you, but could also be horrifying or maddening to comprehend. Once per day, it can negate a failed mental save, taking the effect instead of you. Once per short rest, it can hold concentration on a mental action (such as maintaining a spell) in your stead, allowing you to use your concentration for something else.\n\n\n\n## Dragon\n- [Rage of the Dragon](./): You have a fiery core of draconic power within you.\n  - Rage: when subject to a situation that causes rage, gain 1 Rage. Rage can be used for draconic abilities; otherwise, it slowly subsides toward 0.\n  - Breath Weapon: tbd\n  - Transformation: tbd\n- Wings\n- etc\n\n\n## Elemental\n\n## Sylvan\n\n- [Aquatic Nature](./): Your true form is a water creature, although you can take humanoid form at will. In your true form, you gain water breathing, a swim speed of 40 ft, etc.\n- [Glamour](./): At-will, you can assume an enchantment that enhances your appearance in both visual and magical ways, rendering you unusually attractive and captivating. You gain advantage to any Charisma check for which this would apply (e.g. it is useful for most Persuasion checks, but not so much for Intimidate).\n- [Siren Song](./): Your voice is enchanting beyond mortal constraints. You gain advantage to any Perform checks involving your voice. Also, choose one Bardic Music feat, such as Fascinate, Inspiring Song, etc. You can do that too.\n- [Furry](./): You are a hybrid of human and animal, in a stable (non-shifting) form. Not compatible with Werefolk.\n- [Plantoid](./): You have green skin. You gain energy from sunlight, rather than from eating. You still need water, and occasional vitamins and minerals (about as often as a normal human would). You need at least 8 hours of sun exposure per day to feel \"fed\". Penalties include...whatever the fuck penalties exist for not eating enough, as if anyone even thought of that. TBI\n- [Werefolk](./): You have an animal form and a human form. Your animal form choice gives you certain abilities all the time, and (generally) more powerful abilities when shifted. You suffer an ability called Call of the Wild, which can compel you to transform and act in an animal manner in certain circumstances (e.g. predators are aroused to hunt by the scent of blood or fear). The full moon triggers your Call powerfully. Example subtypes: wolf, tiger, bear, etc.\n- [Underwater Native](./): You have a swim speed of 6, and you can breathe underwater. You can also breathe above water (because otherwise this ability would be terrible). However, you cannot stay out of the water indefinitely. You need at least 8 hours of \"water time\" per day. Outside of natural bodies of water, a bath or pool is ideal, but there are also conceivable magical or technological items to recirculate water over you, or even to provide a water-tight suit (sort of a reverse scuba gear) that keeps you hydrated 24/7.\n- [Fey](./): You have iron vulnerability, can be warded by effects that work on outsiders, and you can be bound by your words or by receiving gifts.\n\n## Tiefling\n\n- [Born in Flames](./): Gain resist 50% fire.\n- [Firestarter](./): You can shed flames at will. Add your proficiency bonus as bonus fire damage to unarmed attacks. Enemies who strike you with natural weapons suffer that amount of fire damage.\n- [Infernal Chains](./): You can sprout spiked chains. You can wield them as a weapon (reach, 2h, heavy slashing, can grapple). You can use them as an offhand weapon (reach, 1h, medium damage).\n\n### Rank 2\n- [Demon Wings](./): Gain the ability to slowfall and glide at will. While in use, batlike wings appear.\n\n### Rank 3\n- [Blood Like Fire](./): Gain Immunity to Fire. Requires and replaces Born in Flames.\n- [Wings of the Fallen](./): Gain a fly speed equal to walking speed. Requires and replaces Demon Wings.\n\n\n\n\n## Shadow\n\n- [Cloaked in Shadow](./): When an attacker suffers any level of concealment against you due to low light levels, you gain your proficiency bonus as a bonus to AC (against attacks) or saves against such attacks.\n- [Withering Touch](./): Your touch drains life. Simply touching a plant or insignificant animal (such as an insect) withers and kills it. You may suppress this ability when not desired. As a melee touch attack, you can inflict medium necrotic damage plus 1d4 Con damage.\n\n### Rank 2\n- [Devilsight](./): Gain Darkvision.\n\n\n## Netherkin\n- [Kiss of Death](./): At-will, Dex vs touch AC; light necrotic damage. 1/day/prof bonus, heal the dmg dealt, or gain the dmg dealt as a bonus to one check/save/attack.\n- [Improved Kiss of Death](./): Kiss of Death inflicts heavy damage plus 1d4 Cha damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Background\n\n## Talents\n- [Acting](./): Gain your Charisma bonus to untrained skill checks. Gain advantage to use Deception to play a role.\n- [Musical Talent](./): Gain proficiency in Perform, can use the Bardic Inspiration power.\n\n## Training\n\n\n# Culture\n\n- [Orcish Battle-rage](./): Once per encounter, gain your proficiency bonus again to melee damage, and the same amount of Damage Reduction. Lasts 3 rds.\n- [Gift of the Eldar](./): Encounter, swift; you call upon nature for a minor favor, such as changing the direction of the wind, aiding or hindering natural concealment, a small temperature change, etc.\n- [Cast-Iron Stomach](./): The Earthen races, such as Dwarves, are known for their impressive fortitude. You gain resistance to disease and poison damage, or advantage to saves against disease and poison when non-damaging.\n- [Elf Step](./): When moving over natural terrain, you don't leave tracks, nor make sounds with footsteps, nor are you slowed by natural difficult terrain.\n- [Northern Born](./): Resist cold 50%, ignore natural cold environmental penalties.\n- [Shadowmeld](./): In any area of natural foliage that grants partial concealment, you can become invisible while immobile.\netc...\n\n\n\n# Disposition\n\n## Gods\n\n## Signs\n\n## Marks\n\n\n\n# Equipment?\n\n## Item of Legacy\n\n## Inheritance\n","bodyHtml":"\n<p>Foundation is everything that contributed to your character before they started adventuring.
