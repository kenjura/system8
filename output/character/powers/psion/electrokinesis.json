Any other ferrous objects within 1 square are attracted to or repelled by it.\n  - If unattended, they simply move. Attracted objects cling to the target, while repelled objects fly away (push 3).\n  - If attended, the wielder can either let go, or fight the effect (Str negates each round). While under the influence of magnetism, a held object (such as a weapon) has disadvantage to attacks.\n  - If the target is a suit of metal armor, you can make it stick to itself by varying the magnetic charge on different pieces. This causes the subject to suffer a 50% movement penalty.\n- Static Charge: at-will, swift; you build up an electrical charge on your body. Thereafter, you can release it along with a touch attack, a metal melee weapon attack, or upon physical contact with any other creature or object (such as when a creature hits you with a natural weapon). When released, it causes heavy lightning damage.\n  - By expending Focus, you can add a stun to this effect. Subject suffers stunned for 1 rd (Con negates).\n- Magnetokinesis: as [Telekinesis](#), but only for ferro-magnetic targets.\n- Lightning Strike: at-will, std, ranged; heavy lightning damage. Or, no damage, but subject is stunned for 1 rd (Con negates).\n  - By expending Focus, you can affect all targets within 2 squares.\n\n# Enhancements\n- By expending 2 Focus, you can cause your Lightning Strike to chain up to 3 times to different targets in range.\n\n# Talents\n- [Lightning Shield](#): by reserving 1 Focus, you can automatically activate a Static Charge as a free action every round.\n- [Ionization](#): whenever you inflict lightning damage on a subject, you cause Ionization, which imposes Vulnerable 100% (lightning) for the next instance of lightning damage they suffer.","bodyHtml":"\n<h1>Electrokinesis</h1>\n<p>You control the Electromagnetic Force, allowing you to control electricity and magnetism.</p>\n<h1>Rank 1</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Magnetize: at-will, std, concentration; target metal object becomes highly magnetized.
