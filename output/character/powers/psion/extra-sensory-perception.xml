class: Psion
name: Extra-Sensory Perception
title: Extra-Sensory Perception
school: Clairsentience
rank: 1
type: Enhancement
brief: Perceive things spookily, at a distance
---

You can extend your senses beyond what is physically possible.

You can blindsense in a radius of 1 square per proficiency bonus.

At-will, swift, concentration, reserves Focus; you perceive an area that you specify within range, regardless of intervening concealment or cover. It is as if a camera (with microphone) were present at the location, streaming its data telepathically to your mind. While you are perceiving this location, your own body's natural perception is suppressed, making you effectively deaf and blind. You can return to your senses as a free action, which does not end the effect if you do not wish; you can return to the remote viewing location as a swift action.
- At rank 2, you can reposition the sensor as a swift action without having to spend additional mana. You can also target the immediate vicinity of a close acquaintance, rather than just the local area.
