Despite the name, &#34;hard light&#34; is not light. It is not made of photons, and its properties do not come from light. Rather, it is a field that can be generated with the application of psionic energy, which modifies a two-dimensional area of space, polarizing the quantum foam to produce a bias in a specified direction.

Normally, a virtually infinite number of particle-antiparticle pairs are constantly erupting into existence from nothingness, then annihilating each other in the same moment, seemingly neutralizing their existence. 

When these annihilations are biased in a specific direction, the &#34;pressure&#34; from their constant explosions becomes coherent, rather than neutralizing to zero. This has the effect of producing a barrier that seems to cancel all kinetic energy. Matter and energy encountering these &#34;walls of force&#34; find that the quantum action of their motion cannot propagate through the wall. The energy of the annihilations does not persist in reality, as it is still negated, but it produces a normal force against any collision equal to the input force--effectively, it is an immovable wall that does not have any limit to the energy it can absorb, and is not itself changed in any way by such collisions.

In game terms, you can make walls of force. At first, they must be flat discs, and relatively small, but you can learn to bend them into other shapes (still made of two-dimensional areas, but curved in the third dimension).</contents>
