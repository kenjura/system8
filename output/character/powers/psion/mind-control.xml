# Mind Control

Despite the name, it's more like Body Control. You replace the subject's consciousness, and have full control of their body. You don't directly gain access to their knowledge and mental abilities (although, being in their mind, you probably have other ways to get it). They can contest you for control and attempt to eject you.</contents>
