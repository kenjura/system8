# Schism

You can separate a fraction of your mind, and use it for various purposes.

At-will, swift, 2 Mana; you create a shard of your mind. Thereafter, you can use the shard for the following purposes:
- The shard can hold concentration on a power without using your concentration slot.
- If you suffer a hostile mental effect, you can direct it to the shard, which suffers the normal effect, but your &#34;main&#34; mind does not.
- The shard gets its own standard action each round, like a minion (and it counts as your minion). It can only take mental actions, but that includes manifesting psionic powers.
- As a standard action, you can project the shard into another creature's body. Thereafter, you share their perception, and can easily target them with psionic powers. They suffer disadvantage to any such powers. As for the shard itself, they are allowed a Charisma save each round to eject it.
