title: Precognition
school: Clairsentience
rank: 1
type: Enhancement
brief: See things before they happen, gaining defensive advantages
---

You sense things before they occur.

At-will, reaction to an incoming harmful effect, 1 Mana; you take a single chosen move or swift action which helps you avoid or mitigate the effect.
- At rank 2, you can spend 2 Mana to use a standard action instead.

At-will, std, 1 Mana; you prognosticate the near future, considering a single proposed course of action, such as &#34;what if I open the left door instead of the right?&#34;. Through the power of precognition, you receive a barrage of visions of possible outcomes, which boil down to &#34;good outcome&#34;, &#34;bad outcome&#34;, &#34;mixture of good and bad&#34;, or &#34;neither good nor bad&#34;. The course of action is something that should fit within the next hour or so. Seeing further into the future is too difficult at this rank.</contents>
