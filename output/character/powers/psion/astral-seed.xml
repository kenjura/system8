brief: Create realms in the Astral Plane.

You create a shard of your own mind within the Astral Plane. Thereafter, the shard can slowly grow a demiplane of your own devising, which you can mentally visit at any time through meditation.

At a certain point, you can establish enough presence in your demiplane such that, if you die in another plane, your mind reforms inside the demiplane. This power does not itself grant you the ability to create a new physical body, but you could use other powers to create one, repair the old one, or possess someone else's.
