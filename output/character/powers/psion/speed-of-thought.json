Since the travel is instant, gravity has no time to affect you. You could travel from one stable platform to another, even if there was a chasm in between.

Treat it as if you took a single very long stride, without your feet making contact with any intervening squares.\n\nFor +1 mana you can double the range of the movement.","bodyHtml":"\n<p>At-will, move, requires focus, 1 mana; you compress the space in front of you, then move through it at otherwise normal speed.
