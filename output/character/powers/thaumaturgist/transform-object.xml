class: Thaumaturgist
name: Transform Object
school: Transmutation
rank: 1
type: Utility
brief: Change properties of an object--size, hardness, form, etc
---

At-will, std, ranged, concentration, 1 Mana; medium-sized (or smaller) object is modified in one way that you choose:
- You can increase or decrease the size by 1 category per rank.
- You can increase or decrease the object's Damage Threshold by 5 points per rank.
- You can increase or decrease the AC bonus of a piece of armor by 4 points per rank (minimum 0).
- You can change the object's form into some other object of the same composition and mass. How useful the item is is based on your Crafting skill check.

By spending 1 extra point of Mana, you can choose two effects instead of one (stackable).

At rank 2, you gain additional uses:
- You can make a solid flexible like rubber or pliable like clay. You can make clay as hard as steel.

At rank 3, you gain additional uses:
- You can change the phase of a solid to a liquid, liquid to either solid or gas, or gas to liquid. No plasma or Bose-Einstein condensates, silly.</contents>
