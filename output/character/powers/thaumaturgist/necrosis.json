{"name":"necrosis","contents":"---\nclass: Thaumaturgist\nname: Necrosis\nschool: Death\nrank: 2\ntype: Control\nbrief: Use subject's own abilities as you direct\n---\n\n\n# Necrosis\n\nStandard action, ranged, concentration; part of subject's body dies, then grows into a new limb, head, or whatever is needed, which wields the subject's own strength against it and its allies.\n\nWhen you cast this spell, you may direct the necrosis to use an ability belonging to the subject, which you choose, as you direct. For example, you can direct the necrosis to attack a nearby target (or even the subject themself) with a natural attack, or tell it to cast a spell. As a swift action, you may issue new commands; otherwise, the necrosis continues following your last command as best it can.\n\nCasting this spell does not imbue you with knowledge of the subject's powers. Any ability you have seen them use is fair game. You may guess at a power, if you had reason to suspect it (for example, you might guess that a creature wielding a magic orb can evoke some sort of power from said orb).\n\nAll attacks and checks made by the necrosis use the subject's statistics, not your own. For instance, melee attacks use the Strength of the host, and magical attacks use the magical skills of the host.\n\nAnyone who wishes to can attack the necrosis, causing damage to it and its host equally. The necrosis has hit points equal to your medium damage roll. At zero HP, the necrosis is destroyed.","bodyHtml":"\n<h1>Necrosis</h1>\n<p>Standard action, ranged, concentration; part of subject's body dies, then grows into a new limb, head, or whatever is needed, which wields the subject's own strength against it and its allies.</p>\n<p>When you cast this spell, you may direct the necrosis to use an ability belonging to the subject, which you choose, as you direct.
