class: Thaumaturgist
name: Drain Soul
school: Soul
rank: 1
type: Debilitation and Enhancement
brief: Enervate enemy and gain a soul gem, which can grant you access to their identity and abilities
---

At-will, std, touch, 1 mana; you steal a portion of the subject's soul, coalescing it into a tiny crystal called a Soul Shard.

The subject suffers Enervation (TBD)

The uses of a soul shard are as follows:
- Use as the sympathetic component of a phylactery
- Speak with the subject's voice
- Attempt to convince a magical effect that distinguishes between targets that you are, in fact, the creature from whom the soul shard was drained
- As a reaction, you can redirect a targeted magical effect that was about to harm you to the subject instead. This expends the shard.
