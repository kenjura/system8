class: Thaumaturgist
name: Soulgaze
school: Soul
rank: 1
type: Utility
brief: Lock eyes with target and learn their secrets--but they learn yours, too
---

At-will, swift, ranged; you gaze into subject's eyes. If they are aware of the danger of locking eyes with you, and wish not to, they're allowed a Dex save to negate. Otherwise, your souls connect, and you learn several things:
- You learn if they have a soul, and what type. You can tell a mortal from an immortal, you detect strong planar alignments (such as fey or demons), and powerful bonds to immortal forces (such as a paladin's oath or a warlock's pact).
- You learn a nugget of knowledge about their true, moral self. This takes the form of a vision, either a direct memory, or a more abstract representation. This information is always true, but can be slightly vague. In any case, it gives you a useful clue about the morality and intentions of the target. It doesn't reveal specific information, like passwords, secret locations, etc. Also, when this happens, the subject learns a similar nugget about you.
