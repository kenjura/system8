At-will, std, ranged, 2 Mana; choose an active, ongoing, harmful effect that the creature is suffering. It immediately causes 2 rounds worth of effects.

For example, if a creature suffers medium necrotic damage on turn start, they suffer medium necrotic damage twice instantly. If such an effect had a save to negate or end each turn, they roll two such saves, and they have the normal effect.

At rank 3, you may spend 3 Mana to cause 3 rounds' worth of effects; etc.


Notes:
- Can this speed up a Frost Bomb? Interesting...</contents>
