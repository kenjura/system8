At-will, std, ranged, requires the creature's blood, concentration, 2 Mana; you take control of subject's actions. Their mind retains awareness of this fact, but you simply overpower them, forcing their body to move as you direct.

You can force them to move and take physical actions such as attacks, although they do so clumsily (disadvantage to hit), as their movements are jerky and irregular, due to them resisting your influence. It is a swift action to direct their actions for one round. Unlike a normal minion, they do not continue acting as you direct when not directly controlled.

You can also simply harm them, twisting their body into unnatural shapes, or causing internal trauma. As a standard action (except in the first round, where it is swift), you may cause heavy internal damage to the creature.

The subject is allowed a Con save to end the effect.</contents>
