class: Thaumaturgist
name: Magic Missile
school: Transmutation
rank: 0
type: Assault and Utility
brief: Telekinetically control an object
---

At-will, std, touch, 0 Mana; touched tiny object propels suddenly in a direction of your choice. If aimed at a creature, make a ranged attack (Spellcasting skill vs AC), inflicting medium damage (type as appropriate given the object's constitution) on a hit. If the object is meant to be lethal, such as a blade, it inflicts heavy damage instead.

If the object doesn't strike a target, but does strike a wall or unyielding surface, it suffers the same damage, but to itself.

If the object is smaller than tiny in size, it inflicts one category less in damage per size category.

You can also use this ability with more finesse, causing the object to move more slowly as you direct; in this manner, it becomes a concentration.</contents>
