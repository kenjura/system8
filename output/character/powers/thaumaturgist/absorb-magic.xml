class: Thaumaturgist
name: Absorb Magic
school: Soul
rank: 1
type: Defense and Utility
brief: Absorb energy from a touched spell, weakening or dispelling it
---

At-will, std, touch, 1 mana; you attempt to dispel a magical effect by touch.

Roll spellcasting skill vs the caster;
- On success, you dispel the effect.
- On failure, you do not dispel it, and instead suffer any harmful effect the spell normally has on its enemies (if any).


# Readied
If you ready an action to do so, you may use this spell to defend yourself against an incoming targeted spell (must still win the opposed check, etc).


# Reversed
1 action, ranged, 1 mana; you force extra mana into a spell, attempting to overload it. Roll against its DC (+4 bonus per extra Mana spent beyond 1); if you win, targeted spell explodes. This ends the spell, and causes medium arcane damage in a burst 2.
