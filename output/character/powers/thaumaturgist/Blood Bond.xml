Uses:
- Blood Boil: at-will, std, touch or ranged (if you are touching their blood); subject suffers heavy internal fire damage.
- Blood Bending: at-will, std, touch or ranged (if you are touching their blood), requires a sympathetic component (blood), concentration, Cha ends; subject awkwardly moves as you direct. You must share actions with subject (i.e. to make them take a standard action, you spend a standard action to concentrate on controlling them).
- Transfusion: at-will, std, touch or ranged (if you are touching their blood), Con half (when harming); transfer HP between yourself and the subject in the direction of your choice. When healing, you can transfer no more HP than would reduce you to 0 or fully heal the target (whichever amount is lower). When harming, you can transfer no more HP than would reduce the target to 0 or fully heal yourself (whichever amount is lower). </contents>
