{"name":"lightning-rod","contents":"---\nclass: Artificer\nname: Lightning Rod\ntype: Invention\n---\n\nYou become a conduit for electrical energy, drawing power from storms, friction, and the bioelectric fields of living creatures.\n\nUses:\n- Spark: at-will; as a swift action, you build up static charge in your body. As a standard action (which can be in a later round), you discharge this energy as a melee touch attack or ranged attack (close), inflicting heavy electrical damage plus [stunned](../../../system/conditions/stunned.md) (Con ends).\n- Static Field: at-will, swift, concentration; electrical energy crackles around you in a protective aura. Any creature that starts their turn adjacent to you or attacks you in melee suffers light electrical damage. Additionally, you gain resistance to electrical damage.\n- Chain Lightning: recharge 33%, std, ranged; you unleash a bolt of lightning that arcs between targets. Primary target suffers heavy electrical damage, then the lightning jumps to the nearest enemy within close range of the primary target, dealing medium damage, then to the nearest enemy within close range of that target, dealing light damage.\n\nRank 2:\n- Tesla Coil: recharge 33%, std, ranged, concentration, zone close burst 2; you create a crackling tower of electrical energy. At the start of each of your turns, all enemies in the zone suffer medium electrical damage. The coil can be attacked (AC 15, HP = 100% heavy damage, immune to electrical, vulnerable to water/cold).\n- Overload:\n  - Power Surge: recharge 33%, swift, concentration; you supercharge your electrical abilities. For the duration, all your electrical attacks deal +1 damage die and gain the [dazed](/system/conditions/dazed.md) condition on hit.\n  - Short Circuit: recharge 33%, std, ranged, concentration; target creature's nervous system is overwhelmed with electrical energy. Subject must make a Con save--on failure, they are [paralyzed](/system/conditions/paralyzed.md) and suffer light electrical damage at the start of each turn. On success, they suffer heavy electrical damage plus [stunned](/system/conditions/stunned.md) but are otherwise fine.\n\nRank 3:\n- Lightning Storm: recharge 50%, std, area burst 4; multiple lightning bolts strike random targets in the area. Roll 1d4+2 for number of bolts, each bolt targets a random creature (friend or foe) in the area for heavy electrical damage.\n- Ride the Lightning: recharge 33%, move, ranged; you transform into pure electrical energy and travel instantly to any point within far range along a path that electricity could reasonably follow (power lines, metal objects, water, etc.). Any creature you pass through suffers medium electrical damage.","bodyHtml":"\n<p>You become a conduit for electrical energy, drawing power from storms, friction, and the bioelectric fields of living creatures.</p>\n<p>Uses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spark: at-will; as a swift action, you build up static charge in your body.
