It is not that literal blood has energy, but rather blood is sympathetically linked to the life energy of the being to which it belongs. Blood from a dead creature, or blood that has been separated long enough to cool, bears little to no vital energy.\n\nYou can gain Blood Vitae by letting blood--either yours or someone else's. The blood of others becomes symbolically yours by the act of either being offered it (in the case of an ally), or taking it unwilling, such as when attacking a creature.\n\nBlood Vitae has the effect of intensifying your most primeval instincts. A modest amount will energize you, readying you to fight or flee, alerting your senses, etc. A large amount will agonize your hunger, intensify your fear, and send your heart racing as life becomes too much.\n\n\n\n\n# Spells\n\nBesides the below schools, you may learn spells from the Air, Frost, and Plants schools of the [Elementalist](./elementalist).\n\n\n## Blood\nRank | Power          | Description\n-----|----------------|------------\n0    | [Blood Boil](../powers/thaumaturgist/blood-boil)     |\n1    | [Transfusion](../powers/thaumaturgist/transfusion)    |\n2    | [Blood Bond](../powers/thaumaturgist/blood-bond)     | Share your strength with allies, or steal strength from enemies\n2    | [Blood Bending](../powers/thaumaturgist/blood-bending) | Control a creature's movements\n3    | [Frozen Blood](../powers/thaumaturgist/frozen-blood)   | Your blood doesn't flow; damage doesn't affect you while active (but still must be healed)\n3    | [Exsanguinate](../powers/thaumaturgist/exsanguinate)   | Drain all the blood from a creature\n\nIdeas:\n- Let Blood: take damage, add it to your spells\n- Bloodborne: infect subject with a bloodborne pathogen:\n  - Hemophilia (slashing/piercing causes ongoing damage)\n  - Sickle-cell (debilitating pain)\n  - Anemia (causes exhaustion)\n  - Should Blood Boil be rolled into this?\n- Burning Blood: dripped blood becomes a burning square\n- Ring of Fire\n- Blood Nova (target can be friendly or enemy, but only harms others)\n\n## Illusion\n\nRank | Power         | Description\n-----|---------------|------------\n0    | Phantom Sound |\n1    | Figment       | Create an illusory creature or object\n1    | Glamour       | Change your appearance\n1    | Mystic Eyes   | See through others' illusions\n2    | Veil          | Invisibility\n2    | Mirror Image  |\n2    | Hallucination | Total illusory control of an area--create walls, multiple creatures/objects, etc\n3    | Simulacrum    | Create an image of a creature that is real enough to affect the world, cast spells, etc\n3    | Phantom Zone  | Send a creature into an illusory domain you control (similar to 3e Maze spell)\n\n\n## Hex\n\nRank | Power          | Description\n-----|----------------|------------\n0    | [Hex](../powers/thaumaturgist/hex)            | Subject has disadvantage to the next attack, skill check, or save they make; you can specify the ability score to hex.\n1    | [Curse](../powers/thaumaturgist/curse)          | Curse an enemy with weakness, clumsiness, or frailty\n2    | [Malediction](../powers/thaumaturgist/malediction)    | Curse an enemy with vulnerability, lethargy, or distraction\n3    | [Doom](../powers/thaumaturgist/doom)           | Curse an enemy to wither away, harm themselves, or fail at all endeavors\n\n\n## Antimagic\n\nRank | Power          | Description\n-----|----------------|------------\n1    | [Absorb Magic](../powers/thaumaturgist/absorb-magic)   | Absorb energy from a touched spell, weakening or dispelling it\n2    | [Negation](../powers/thaumaturgist/negation)       | Disable a single spell or magic item so it can't be used\n2    | [Commandeer Spell](../powers/thaumaturgist/commandeer-spell) | Take control of a spell, changing it as you please\n3    | Antimagic Zone | Area nullifies magic\n\nTodo: merge negation and commadeer spell into Spellsteal\n\n\n## Soul\n\nRank | Power          | Description\n-----|----------------|------------\n0    | [Soulgaze](../powers/thaumaturgist/soulgaze)       | Lock eyes with target and learn their secrets--but they learn yours, too\n1    | [Drain Soul](../powers/thaumaturgist/drain-soul)     | Enervate enemy and gain a soul gem, which can grant you access to their identity and abilities\n2    | Magic Jar      | You detach your soul from your body, which becomes helpless.

The result of this check remains true for the duration of that particular instance of the spell.\n- [Spell Stowaway](#): Whenever an enemy within range casts a beneficial spell, you may, as a reaction, manifest a copy of their spell affecting you or an ally.\n- [Vital Shield](#): Whenever you are harmed by a spell, you can expend 1 Vitae to reduce the damage by half, or to gain advantage to the saving throw.\n\n\n### Revelation\n- [Foresight](#): once/day, react to anything\n- [Prognostication](#): at-will, swift, ranged; you predict the target's next action. When they take it, whatever it is, you may spend a reaction to react to it.\n-\n\n### Transference\n- [Manifest Phylactery](#): at-will, swift, requires a sympathetic component; you manifest a temporary phylactery of the target, lasting until a short rest. You can convert this to a permanent phylactery if you conduct the normal ritual immediately after combat.\n- [Spell Channel](#): if you inflict harm with a spell, natural attack, or a weapon you're currently wielding, you can use that as a channel to puncture that opponent's defenses.

If expended, it can grant advantage to one spell or attack roll against them, as well as increasing damage by 50%.\n\n### Verity\n- [Mystic Eyes](#): at will, you can see through glamours, figments, and invisibility spells.\n\n\n### Entropy\n- [Bad Luck](#): Shit happens. It's a well-known axiom of witchcraft. But with careful study and perception, you can learn not to be in front of the fan when it happens. When you roll a d20, and the result is at or below your Entropy rank, you can \"store\" the result, rolling again. When you have a stored result, you can impose it upon any other PC or NPC whenever they roll a d20, expending it and forcing them to take your result.\n- [Death and Decay](#): All things decay. This is something you've accepted. But you don't have to dive into the grave on purpose. You gain Resist 50% (necrotic), and advantage to saves against death magic and ability damage/drain.\n- [Death Becomes You](#): The undead are the antithesis of the living, and naturally hate, fear, and long to feed upon them. You understand that, and sympathize with them, and, to an extent, they respect that. Mindless undead become indifferent to you unless actively commanded to attack. Your own undead servants gain inspiration once per encounter.\n\n\n## Blood Magic\nTalent          | Description\n--------------|------------\n[Talisman of Vitality](#) | Whenever you heal for any reason, you may exceed your max HP, gaining the excess as temporary Hit Points, which expire at the end of the encounter.\n[Talisman of Blood](#) | When you are missing Hit Points, you can add your HP debt to the damage of any attack or spell you inflict, to a maximum of 100% of the attack's original damage. This does not change your current HP.\n\n## Familiar\nTalent          | Description\n--------------|------------\n[Familiar](#) | Construct or minor animal becomes a magical servant.\n\n## Necromancy\nTalent          | Description\n--------------|------------\n[Create Undead](#) | Using a corpse and components of non-trivial cost, you can make permanent undead servants.\n\n## Hedgecraft\nTool          | Description\n--------------|------------\n[Deathball](#) | Craftable vessel allowing you to store an undead minion in stasis until needed.\n[Soul Prison](#) | You can create special Soul Gems to house the soul shards of Drain Soul. If a creature dies while you possess their soul shard in such a gem, you trap their soul in the gem.\n\n## Soul\nTool          | Description\n--------------|------------\n[Reactive Absorb](#) | You can use [Absorb Magic](#) as a reaction against any spell targeting you.\n\n\n# Spells that need porting\n- Grudge\n- Foresight\n- Mystic Eyes\n- Spellsteal\n","bodyHtml":"\n<h1>Thaumaturgist</h1>\n<p><img src=\"/img/character/classes/thaumaturgist.jpg\" alt=\"Thaumaturgist\"></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Attribute</th>\n<th>Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Hit Die</td>\n<td>d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HP/level</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weapon Prof.</td>\n<td>Simple</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Armor Prof.</td>\n<td>None</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Saving Throws</td>\n<td>Con, Wis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bonus Skills</td>\n<td>Thaumaturgy</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Special Ability</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Spells, Talents, Vitae</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1>Vitae</h1>\n<p>Types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blood</li>\n<li>Elemental</li>\n<li>Soul</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are ways of gathering each.

This can be used to target them with a spell regardless of line of sight or effect at will. If expended, it can grant advantage to one spell or attack roll against them, as well as increasing damage by 50%.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Verity</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Mystic Eyes</a>: at will, you can see through glamours, figments, and invisibility spells.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Entropy</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Bad Luck</a>: Shit happens. It's a well-known axiom of witchcraft. But with careful study and perception, you can learn not to be in front of the fan when it happens. When you roll a d20, and the result is at or below your Entropy rank, you can &quot;store&quot; the result, rolling again. When you have a stored result, you can impose it upon any other PC or NPC whenever they roll a d20, expending it and forcing them to take your result.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Death and Decay</a>: All things decay. This is something you've accepted. But you don't have to dive into the grave on purpose. You gain Resist 50% (necrotic), and advantage to saves against death magic and ability damage/drain.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Death Becomes You</a>: The undead are the antithesis of the living, and naturally hate, fear, and long to feed upon them. You understand that, and sympathize with them, and, to an extent, they respect that. Mindless undead become indifferent to you unless actively commanded to attack. Your own undead servants gain inspiration once per encounter.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Blood Magic</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Talent</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#\">Talisman of Vitality</a></td>\n<td>Whenever you heal for any reason, you may exceed your max HP, gaining the excess as temporary Hit Points, which expire at the end of the encounter.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"#\">Talisman of Blood</a></td>\n<td>When you are missing Hit Points, you can add your HP debt to the damage of any attack or spell you inflict, to a maximum of 100% of the attack's original damage.
