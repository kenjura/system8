One soul shard does not equal one human soul--its a far smaller quantity, and in any case, not all souls have the same amount of Anima. The Shard is a useful atomic unit, the smallest significant portion of Anima that can be put to use.\n\nYou can acquire Soul Shards in several ways:\n- Your own soul is worth (5 + Cha) x level soul shards. You can spend from your own soul freely, but if you ever possess less than half of your own total, you are vulnerable to control by extraplanar entities, and at 0, you are helpless to resist them.\n- You can drain soul shards from other creatures with various Invoker powers.\n- Each time you convince an individual with a soul to sin, you gain an amount of shards commensurate with the intensity of the sin (1 for a minor venial sin, 5 for a clear mortal sin, more possible in extreme cases).\n\nYou can spend Soul Shards in several ways:\n- Most powers can be empowered by spending shards, as specified in the power's description.\n- There are some general uses for shards (TBD)\n\n\n## Corruption\nCertain temporary abilities from your powers that cost soul shards can become permanent, not requiring them, although it comes at a cost, twisting your mortal form into one more suited to your increasingly extraplanar nature.\n\nTBD\n\n\n\n# Powers\n\nYou gain one power per level.\n\n\n\n##

Fel Armor\n- Chromatic Shield\n- Armor of Darkness\n\nEldritch Blast:\n- Immolation\n- Jubilation\n- Corruption? or just Shadow Bolt\n\n\n\n\n\n# Power Descriptions\n\n## Astral\n\n### Hard Light\nAt-will, swift, concentration; you form light into a crystalline structure of your own design, that you wield with your hand or hands. You can form weapons, shields, handheld tools, etc. They work as well as their mundane counterparts.\n\nFor 1 soul shard, you can make an oversized, supercharged weapon that inflicts heavy damage plus additional benefits based on design:\n- Bludgeoning: each hit causes a push 2 plus knockdown (Str negates).\n- Slashing: you can attack all enemies in a cone 2 with a single melee attack.\n- Piercing: your attacks are a line 5x1.\n\nFor 1 soul shard, you can create a wall up to 10 feet wide and tall per rank. You must maintain contact with it to sustain it, as it is stationary with respect to the ground. The wall blocks all movement and line of effect, but is transparent.\n\n\n## Fey\n\n### Color Spray\nSpray colors on creatures or terrain. TBD\n\n### Curse of Tongues\nInterfere with creature's ability to communicate. TBD\n\n### Fey Step\nRecharge 33%, move; you teleport to a location within 6 squares that you can see.\n- For 1 soul shard, you can extend the range to visual.\n- For 1 soul shard, you can create a doorway that remains open while you concentrate, allowing two-way teleportation, to a maximum duration of 3 rounds.\n- At rank 2, for 2 soul shards, you can create a doorway that does not lead to another doorway in the same plane, but rather into the Feywild (or back out of it, if already inside)\n\n### Glamour\nAt-will, swift, sustained; you change your physical appearance however you please (same size and type, i.e. humanoid, but other factors can change at will). If you optimize your appearance for a specific purpose, such as seduction or intimidation, this effect grants advantage to skill checks toward that purpose.\n- For 1 soul shard, you can become invisible, remaining so as long as you concentrate, do not move more than half speed, and neither inflict nor suffer damage.\n- For 1 soul shard, you can glamour yourself and allies within a burst 2.\n\n### Magic Fingers\nRanged legerdemain, cause sensations with a touch, etc\n\n\n### Siren Song\nYour voice carries magical power, which can be used to:\n- Countersong\n- Fascinate\n- Suggest\netc...\n\nTBD\n\n### Summon Sprites\nSummon a cloud of sprites:\n- Flame\n- Frost\n- Healing?\n- etc\n\n\n## Infernal\n\n### Curse of Agony\nAt-will, std, ranged; subject is immobilized and unable to take actions (Con ends).\n\nEmpowered:\n- For one soul shard, you can cause a wave of pain to all enemies within a burst 2.\n- For one soul shard, you can rend the subject's body, causing medium ongoing internal damage while the effect persists.\n\n\n### Demon Claw\nAt-will, swift, sustained; your hand or hands transform, growing fearsome claws. You gain a claw attack (Str or Dex-based, heavy slashing damage). You gain your Charisma bonus to grapple checks with said claws.\n\nWhen your claws are active, you can conjure fire from them:\n- At-will, std, ranged; you throw a fireball that inflicts heavy fire damage\n- For 1 soul shard, you can add an Immolate effect to each successful melee attack for the next 3 rounds\n\nCorruption:\n- You can make this effect permanent, but your claws never recede.\n\n\n\n### Demonic Sigil\nRecharge 33%, std, ranged, circle 2; you burn a sigil into the ground, which glows with fel energy. Its form and purpose varies based on your choice of sigil:\n\nFree:\n- Magic Circle: barrier cannot be crossed by the bodies of extraplanar beings, nor by their powers. As a standard action, they can attempt to force their way to the other side by passing a Charisma save against your DC.\n\n1 soul shard:\n- Sigil of Flame: enemies in the area suffer medium fire damage on turn start. Allies gain advantage to damage rolls with fire damage effects.\n- Sigil of Protection: all damage suffered by allies within the area is split evenly between all creatures within the sigil.\n- Sigil of Teleportation: creates two linked sigils. Allies stepping in one are teleported to the other (max once/rd per creature).\n\nIdeas:\n- Anti-magic / Stun\n- Trap (Chains)\n- Blood\n\n### Devil's Eye\nAt-will, swift, concentration; you activate a form of vision where you can see the auras of living or magically-animated creatures (even in total darkness). You can tell from the aura if the creature is natural, undead, magically animated (e.g. construct or elemental), or extraplanar (and which planar alignment).\n\nEmpowered:\n- At-will, std, line 3, 1 soul shard; from your eyes, a blast of fel energy surges forth, burning enemies for heavy fire damage.\n\nCorruption:\n- You can make this effect permanent, gaining the vision effect at all times, and gaining the ability to use eye lasers on a recharge 33%. But your eyes always glow with visible fel energy, marking your demonic power plainly.\n\n\n### Immolate\nAt-will, std, ranged; subject bursts into flames, suffering medium fire damage, plus the same ongoing (Dex ends).\n\nEmpowered:\n- For one soul shard, you can cause all enemies in a burst 2 to be immolated.\n- For one soul shard, you can cause an ongoing Immolate effect to cause 3 rounds' worth of damage instantly.\n\n\n### Infernal Wings\nAt-will, free or reaction to falling; you sprout infernal wings, allowing you to glide 5 squares horizontally for each 1 square you fall, and negating falling damage. Your jump distance is doubled in height and length.\n\nEmpowered:\n- For one soul shard, you gain a levitate speed equal to your walking speed for 5 rounds. At rank 2, this becomes a fly speed. At rank 3, the speed doubles.\n\nCorruption:\n- You can make Infernal Wings permanent. This costs nothing, but the wings no longer emerge as needed--they are always present.\n\n### Mana Burn\nAt-will, std, ranged; you attempt to dispel any ongoing spell effect by igniting the mana contained within it. If the effect is upon a creature or object, they suffer medium fire damage. Roll your casting skill vs the power's DC (with a -5 penalty per rank above your own if the effect is higher rank than you). On success, the effect ends.\n- For one soul shard, you can attempt to dispel all spells currently active on a single target, or one spell effect on each target within a burst 2.\n\nRecharge 33%, std, ranged; you attack the magical essence of a creature. If they have generic magical essence, such as Mana or spell slots, you attack those, removing 1d3 of them (1d4+1 at rank 2, 1d6+2 at rank 3, etc), with a Charisma save for half, causing medium fire damage per point removed. You can also target a specific magical ability that does not cost such points (such as an encounter, recharge, or at-will power), causing medium fire damage, and if they fail the save, they lose the ability to use that power for a number of round equal to the die roll previously mentioned.\n- For one soul shard, you can maximize the die roll of mana or rounds.\n\n### Scourge of Seduction\nAt-will, swift, sustained as long as you hold it; you summon a whip, which can be used as a weapon (extended reach, Dex-based, medium slashing damage) which causes pain (on successful damage, subject is immobilized and unable to take actions for 1 round if they fail a Con save). Additional uses:\n- At-will, swift, 3 square reach; subject is grappled by the whip, and unable to move further away unless they defeat you in a Strength contest, disarming you, or if they escape the grapple.\n- At-will, std, 3 square reach, 1 soul shard; subject is stung by the whip (0 damage, but you must still hit), and ensorceled with fel energies. They are compelled to serve you as a faithful minion (Cha ends).\n\n### Wreathed in Flames\nYou gain Resist 50% (fire).\n- For 1 soul shard, as an immediate action, you gain increase this to 100% resistance for 5 rounds.\n\nAt-will, swift, concentration; you immolate yourself, such that enemies who strike you with a natural weapon suffer heavy fire damage each time they do, and enemies within 1 square of you suffer medium fire damage on turn start.\n- If your fire resistance is 100% for any reason, the radiant damage is heavy, not medium, and has a radius of 2 squares.\n\nCorruption:\n- You can make the greater fire resistance permanent, but your skin is permanently demonic (strange color, inhuman texture, markings, etc).\n\n\n## Shadow\n\n### Call of the Void\nInflict fear, madness, or despair upon foes\n\n### Darkness\nCreate darkness.\n\nIdeas:\n- Wall of Shadows\n- Void Zone\n- Armor of Darkness?\n\n### Demi\nRecharge 33%, std, ranged; subject suffers necrotic damage sufficient to reduce their Hit Points to half of maximum (if currently higher). They are allowed a Con save for half damage.\n\nEmpowered:\n- For one soul shard, the damage is sufficient to reduce the target to 1 HP instead.\n- For one soul shard, convert to a circle 2.\n\n### Drain Soul\nAt-will, std, ranged; subject suffers medium necrotic damage, and you gain a soul shard.\n\nIdeas:\n- AoE?\n- Trap the Soul\n\n\n### Shadow Form\nAt-will, swift, sustained; you obscure your features, becoming a silhouette of darkness. If you are in darkness, you become invisible, even to darkvision.\n\nEmpowered:\n- For one soul shard, you can become an incorporeal shadow for 5 rounds.\n- For one soul shard, you can discorporate into a pool of darkness for 1 round as a reaction (recharge 33%).\n\n\n### Shadow Walk\nShadowstep, shadow walk, etc\n\n\n### Star of the Void\nAt-will, std, 1 soul shard; you conjure a mote of pure void, which annihilates everything it touches. Each round, as a standard action, you can command it to attack a single target within range, causing heavy disintegration damage if it hits. When you wish to end the spell, you must spend a standard action and defeat the spell's DC with a Charisma save. On failure, it does not go away, and if you fail by 10 or more, it attacks whoever it pleases. Each time the star strikes for damage, its DC increases by 1.\n\nEnhancement ideas:\n- Use it defensively\n- AoE's (line attacks)\n","bodyHtml":"<h1>Invoker</h1>\n<p><img src=\"/system8/img/character/classes/invoker.jpg\" alt=\"Invoker\"></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Attribute</th>\n<th>Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Hit Die</td>\n<td>d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HP/level</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weapon Prof.</td>\n<td>Simple Weapons, Rod</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Armor Prof.</td>\n<td>None</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Saving Throws</td>\n<td>Int, Cha</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bonus Skills</td>\n<td>Invocation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Special Ability</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1>Abilities</h1>\n<h2>Soul Shards</h2>\n<p>Soul Shards are a unit of measuring Anima, or the essence contained within souls.
