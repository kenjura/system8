In fact, they cause the former to grow wildly and the latter to be healed for half the normal damage.\n\n### Frost\n- [Ice Armor](#): You gain a free Frost Barrier at all times (when desired), which recharges with a short rest.\n- [Regenerating Ice Wall](#): Holes in your Wall of Ice cause cold damage to those passing through, and re-form ice a round after the opening is made.\n\n### Plants\n- [Shillelagh](#): you can touch a stick and turn it into a powerful weapon (heavy damage, martial trait of your choice).\n- [Thorns](#): When Barkskin is active, sharp thorns sprout from you, inflicting medium piercing damage to anyone who strikes you in melee. Entangled enemies are also damaged each time they attempt to escape.\n- [Plant Shape](#): You can Wild Shape into plants.\n\n### Shaman\n- [Elemental Form](#): Become an elemental for a short period.\n- [Totemic Weapon](#): Imbue weapon with elemental energy, granting bonus damage and effects to weapon strikes.\n\n\n### Channeler\n- [Eye of the Storm](#): Each round you maintain Control Winds, it increases in radius. You gain a free Gust of Wind within the radius each round. You can levitate while channeling.\n- [Maelstrom](#): Each round you maintain Control Water, it increases in radius. Other stuff happens.\n- [Wild Growth](#): Each round you maintain Control Plants, it increases in radius. While using it, you can freely Entangle one target each round. The area becomes difficult terrain for enemies.\n- [Firestorm](#): Each round you maintain Produce Flame, it increases in intensity. You can use 1 Mana uses freely once per round. Enemies within (insert radius here) suffer light fire damage on turn start.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Elemental Attunement\nAt-will, swift; you attune yourself to a single element. Thereafter, you gain a number of powers specific to that element. You may use this power again after a short rest. When used again, you lose the previous attunement.\n\n\n# Spells\n\nTo gain access to spells, use the [Elemental Attunement](#elemental-attunement) ability.\n\n## General\n\nRank  | Power             | Description\n------|-------------------|------------\n1     | Summon Elemental  | Summon an earth, fire, air, or water elemental\n2     | Elemental Shield  | Shield of fire, frost, or other elements protects you and has other effects\n\n\n## Air\n\nRank  | Power             | Description\n------|-------------------|------------\n0     | Gust of Wind      | Blast target away from you\n1     | Control Wind      | Create and control winds in an emanation\n1     | Lightning Strike  | Zap enemy with lightning damage\n1     | Rejuvenation      | Heals an ally for a portion of their HP reserve\n2     | Cyclone           | Winds trap target and move them around\n2     | Thin Air          | Vacuum asphyxiates, prevents speech and verbal spellcasting\n2     | Mist Form         | Dissolve yourself into a cloud of mist\n3     | Chain Lightning   | Strike enemy with lightning, which chains to other targets\n3     | Flight            | Fly\n\n## Animal\n\nRank  | Power             | Description\n------|-------------------|------------\n0     | Beast Tongue      | Speak to animals, attempt to charm or compel them\n1     | Roar              | Primal scream terrifies enemies.\n1     | Summon Animal     | Call and control an animal appropriate to the environment\n1     | Infestation       | Swarm of insects or small vermin harass target\n2     | Bloodlust         | Target gains bonus melee damage and movement rate, but can't take complex mental actions like spellcasting\n\n\n## Death\n\nRank | Power             | Description\n-----|-------------------|------------\n1    | Spores            | Puff of spores causes various debilitations\n1    | Fester            | wound grows bacteria and insect infestation, causing necrotic damage and disease\n1    | Sporeling         | animate a recently-dead corpse as an undead using spores\n2    | Deathblossom      | beautiful, deadly plant siphons life energy and heals allies\n3    | Spore Form        | you're a cloud of spores\n\n\n\n## Earth\nRank  | Power           | Description\n------|-----------------|------------\n1     | Fist of Stone   | Strike a foe with earthen fist, or grasp them\n1     | Stomp           | wave of force knocks enemies down and causes damage\n1     | Earth Shape     | Change earth in an area;
