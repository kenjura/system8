{"name":"enchanting","contents":"Enchanting is the skill used to create magic items out of ordinary objects.\n\n\n# Casting Implements\n\n## Wizard's Implement\n**Effect:** The wizard's implement rewards careful preparation and a keen mind.\n- Gain +20% spell haste per rank. This is a chance to gain an immediate free spellcasting action. When the roll fails, the chance carries over into the next round.\n- You have 1 \"prepared slot\" per rank. Once per short rest, you can choose any spell you can cast, and prepare it into this slot. Thereafter, with the normal action cost, you can cast the spell, but it doesn't require an energy source.\n- At rank 2, you can instantly complete a recharge cooldown once per short rest.\n- At rank 3, you can instantly complete an encounter cooldown once per long rest.\n- At rank 4, your recharge rolls double in chance (33->66), and all encounter spells become recharge 10% (doubling to 20).\n- At rank 5, blee.\n\n**Market Value:** 1 gp / 4 gp / 16 gp / 24 gp / 50 gp\n\n\n## Sorceror's Implement\n**Effect:** The sorceror's implement rewards a forceful mind and a deep commitment to the pursuit of magical power.\n- Gain +1/2/3/4/5 Hit Power (add this number to each damage die) when casting spells with the implement.\n- Once per short rest per rank, you may Empower a spell, adding +100% damage.\n- At rank 2, you may choose to Doublecast, which uses an Empower charge to instead cast a second spell as a free action, immediately after a normal spellcasting action.\n- At rank 3, your spell damage rolls always have advantage.\n- At rank 4, tbd\n- At rank 5, tbd\n\n**Market Value:** 1 gp / 4 gp / 16 gp / 24 gp / 50 gp\n\n\n## Adept's Implement\n**Effect:** The adept's implement rewards a patient and intuitive mind.\n- Gain +1/2/3/4/5 to Hit and spell DC.\n- The implement can hold concentration for you, acting like a normal concentration effect, but not using your concentration. If you take damage, you don't have to roll a concentration check, although if the implement itself takes damage, you do.\n- At rank 2, you can quicken a defense, enhancement, mobility, summoning, healing, or utility spell once per short rest, making it a free action.\n- At rank 3, you can designate a specific trigger (such as \"I suffer more than 5 damage\" or \"an enemy casts a harmful spell at me or an ally\"), under which a single chosen spell will automatically be cast as an immediate action to counter it.\n- Rank 4/5 tbd\n\n**Market Value:** 1 gp / 4 gp / 16 gp / 24 gp / 50 gp\n\n\n## Occult Implement\n**Effect:** The occult implement is for a wielder of secret magic, who benefits from subtlety.\n- Gain +1 critical threat range and +50% critical damage per rank.\n- You may absorb the implement into yourself, gaining its power without needing to wield it in your hand. Also, when you strike a foe against whom you have Combat Advantage, you inflict critical bonus damage.\n- At rank 2, you need not use somatic components to cast.\n- At rank 3, you need not use verbal components to cast.\n- At rank 4, your spells produce no magical aura, and cannot be detected in the usual manner.\n- At rank 5, your enemies are always unaware of your spells, unless they can somehow see the future.\n\n**Market Value:** 1 gp / 4 gp / 16 gp / 24 gp / 50 gp\n\n\n\n# Todo\n| ---- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1    | Augur's Bones              | Bones that help you determine the near future (i.e. Augury)                                                                                                |\n| 1    | Hand of Glory              | Mummified hand allows the delivery of touch spells at range via a ghostly hand                                                                             |\n| 1    | Figurine of Wondrous Power | Figurine of pewter, glass, etc is actually a vessel for a living creature (animal, humanoid, etc).
