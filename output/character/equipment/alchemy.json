Thereafter, the bottle's magic keeps environmental air from collapsing into the void, maintaining the vacuum in the area. The bottle's magic is finite, so the radius decreases by 1 square every 2 rounds (3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0). If allowed to drain fully, it releases the stored air into the environment, which shatters the bottle and causes a loud clap that might pop your ears. If stoppered before fully draining, the bottle contains the air that was sucked in, and the vacuum maintenance fades quickly, causing a burst of wind that is painful, but probably not as painful as the vacuum was. A stoppered vial will release its stored air when shattered or unstoppered.\n\n\n## Utility\n\n| Rank | Name              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| ---- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 1    | Alarm             | A bell, whistle, or other noisemaker is enchanted to warn you when a perimeter is violated.                                                                                                                  |\n| 1    | Dust of Detection | Blow dust of various colors which outlines magical auras.
