<contents>How to balance low level? Easy as ABC.

- Ancestry, Background, and Class
- Each grants abilities and at least one item at level 1

In 8.2:
- Ancestry granted 3 abilities at level 0 and more on the 3/7/11/15/19 track. No items
- Background didn't exist
- Some classes have bonus feats at level 1, but it's hit or miss

In 8.3:
- Each one should grant one ability and one item, plus a floating ability of your choice
- Each one should also grant an aspiration
- Ancestry abilities are unchanged, items are...tbd
- Background is similar to Ancestry
- Class should grant a level's worth of normal abilities as its level 1 bonus, as opposed to older ideas like cantrips or martial weapon proficiency
  - Fighters get a fine weapon or armor
  - Casters get an implement
